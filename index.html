In this riveting re-creation, the vast, worldwide scope of the major turning point of World War II comes to unforgettable life.In Washington, D.C., the U.S. and Japanese governments move toward irreversible confrontation. In Tokyo, Emperor Hirohito strains to hear, amid the crackling radio static, the first reports of war. Landings in Malaya and Thailand at midnight are timed to coincide across the thousands of miles of ocean with carrier-plane and suicide-sub attacks at daylight on Hawaii.In Russia, in the subzero snows, the German onslaught crests against the furious counterattacks of a Red Army rising from its ruins. In North Africa, in the torrid sands about besieged Tobruk, Rommel's Afrika Korps discovers its limits. In Nazi-occupied Europe, in a bleak Polish forest, Hitler's "final solution" is given its first grisly trial run.In the kaleidoscope of Stanley Weintraub's narrative, events reveal themselves in dramatic hour-by-hour simultaneous time as scenes shift from frontlines to home fronts. Meticulously researched, startling in its revelations and in its juxtaposition of events, Long Day's Journey Into War is gripping, riveting history.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>This is a revolutionary book about the nature of emotion, about the way emotions are triggered in our private moments, in our relations with others, and by our biology. Drawing on every theme of the modern life sciences, Dr. Nathanson shows how the nine basic affects--interest-excitement, enjoyment-joy, surprise-startle, fear-terror, distress-anguish, anger-rage, dissmell, disgust, and shame-humiliation--not only determine how we feel but shape our very sense of self. For too long there has been a battle between those who explain emotional discomfort on the basis of lived experience and those who blame chemistry. As Dr. Nathanson shows, chemicals and illnesses can affect our mood just as surely as an uncomfortable memory or a stern rebuke. He presents a completely new understanding of all emotion, providing the first link between the exciting affect theory of Silvan Tomkins and the entire world of biology, medicine, psychology, psychotherapy, religion, and the social sciences. Shame is the least understood of the painful emotions, although it affects every phase of life. We have all been made to feel foolish just at the moment we most wanted to appear wonderful; we have all been rebuffed by those we wished to court. Not one of us looks exactly as we might wish. Shame haunts our every dream of love, and influences how we experience ourselves as sexual beings. We react to shame by withdrawing, by making painful alliances with those who humiliate us, by calling attention to what brings us pride, or by attacking whoever has made us feel inferior. The comedian, as Nathanson shows in his discussion of Buddy Hackett, makes us laugh at what we try to keep hidden, transforming shame intoacceptance and even pride. This book explains everything that can possibly make us proud or ashamed. All are in this book; nobody who reads it will be quite the same again.Donald L. Nathanson, M.D., is the founder and Executive Director of the Silvan S. Tomkins Institute. He is currently Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Jefferson Medical College.</p><h2>India: A History</h2><p>Accommodating Pakistan and Bangladesh and other embryonic nation states like the Sikh Punjab, Muslim Kashmir and Assam, this text examines the legacy of the 1947 partition, and looks at the colonial era from the overal context of Indian history. India&#39;s history begins with a highly advanced urban civilization in the Indus Valley, regressing to a tribal and pastoral nomadism, and then evolving into a uniquely stratified society. The pattern of inward invasion plus outward migration was established early: from Alexander the Great via the March of Islam and the great Moghuls to the coming of the East India Company and the establishment of the British Raj. Older, richer and more distinctive than almost any other, India&#39;s culture furnishes all that the historian could wish for in the way of continuity and diversity. The peoples of the Indian subcontinent, while sharing a common history and culture, are not now, and never have been, a single unitary state.</p><p>The history of what is now India stretches back thousands of years, further than that of nearly any other region on earth. Yet, observes historian John Keay, most historical work on India concentrates on the period after the arrival of Europeans, with predictable biases, distortions, and misapprehensions. One, for example, is the tendency to locate the source of social conflict in India's many religions--to which Keay retorts, "Historically, it was Europe, not India, which consistently made religion grounds for war."<p> Taking the longest possible view, Keay surveys what is both provable and invented in the historical record. His narrative begins in 3000 B.C., with the complex, and little-understood, Harappan period, a time of state formation and the development of agriculture and trade networks. This period coincides with the arrival of Indo-European invaders, the so-called Aryans, whose name, of course, has been put to bad use at many points since. Keay traces the growth of subsequent states and kingdoms throughout antiquity and the medieval period, suggesting that the lack of unified government made the job of the European conquerors somewhat easier--but by no means inevitable. He continues to the modern day, his narrative ending with Indian-Pakistani conflicts in 1998.</p><p> Fluently told and well documented, Keay's narrative history is of much value to students and general readers with an interest in India's past and present. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>John Keay is a writer, broadcaster and historian whose books include `Into India&#39;, `India Discovered&#39;, `When Men and Mountains Meet&#39;, `Highland Drove&#39;, `The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company&#39;, `The Great Arc&#39;, `China: A History&#39; and (with his wife, Julia Keay) the `Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland&#39;. He has travelled extensively in India and the Far East, and specialised in Asian history and current affairs.</p><h2>After the Empire: The Breakdown of the American Order (European Perspectives: A Series in Social Thought and Cultural Criticism)</h2><p>Widely reviewed and critically praised, Emmanuel Todd's <i>After the Empire</i> predicts that the United States is forfeiting its superpower status as it moves away from traditional democratic values of egalitarianism and universalism, lives far beyond its means economically, and continues to anger foreign allies and enemies alike with its military and ideological policies. As America's global dominance evaporates, Todd foresees the emergence of a Eurasian alliance bringing together Europe, Russia, Japan, and the Arab-Islamic world.<br><br>Todd calmly and straightforwardly takes stock of many negative trends, including America's weakened commitment to the socio-economic integration of African Americans, a bulimic economy that increasingly relies on smoke and mirrors and the goodwill of foreign investors, and a foreign policy that squanders the country's reserves of "soft power" while its militaristic arsonist-fireman behavior is met with increasing resistance. Written by a demographer and historian who foresaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, this original and daring book cannot be ignored.</p><p><i>After the Empire</i> is a provocative and sobering look at America's changing role on the global stage. Emmanuel Todd uses demographic and economic factors to diagnose America's waning hegemony, offering a compelling reevaluation of its status as a superpower. Burdened by enormous domestic and foreign trade deficits, the declining value of the U.S. dollar, the unanticipated bankruptcy of several prominent companies, and the fact that it can no longer subsist on its own production, America is becoming ever more dependent on foreign money. And as it continues to anger foreign allies and enemies alike with its military and ideological policies, America is beginning to experience a resistance to its unilateralism. A critically acclaimed, international best-seller, After the Empire is an urgent appeal for America to return to its role as a democratic, productive, and cooperative member of the global community.Emmanuel Todd is a researcher at the French National Institute for Demographic Studies.

Now, he faces his most important&#x2015;and difficult&#x2015;audience yet. Using clear language and vivid examples, Varoufakis offers a series of letters to his young daughter about the economy: how it operates, where it came from, how it benefits some while impoverishing others. Taking bankers and politicians to task, he explains the historical origins of inequality among and within nations, questions the pervasive notion that everything has its price, and shows why economic instability is a chronic risk. Finally, he discusses the inability of market-driven policies to address the rapidly declining health of the planet his daughter&#x2019;s generation stands to inherit. </p><p> Throughout, Varoufakis wears his expertise lightly. He writes as a parent whose aim is to instruct his daughter on the fundamental questions of our age&#x2015;and through that knowledge, to equip her against the failures and obfuscations of our current system and point the way toward a more democratic alternative.</p></p><p><b>Yanis Varoufakis</b> is a former finance minister of Greece and a cofounder of an international grassroots movement, DiEM25, that is campaigning for the revival of democracy in Europe.

'Ensuring that everyone is allowed to talk authoritatively about the economy is a prerequisite for a good society and a precondition for an authentic democracy' [he writes]. If this is his goal, then Varoufakis has more than achieved it . . .

Misadventures in the Counterculture</h2><p>The memoirs of counterculture icon Paul Krassner traces the manic adventures of the man who founded The Realist, a forum for such 1960s personalities as Norman Mailer, Lenny Bruce, and Richard Albert. 35,000 first printing. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Actually, on the evidence here, Krassner--founder/editor of The Realist and the most outrageous cultural critic of his era--no longer raves now that he's in his 60s. Which is just as well, because otherwise it's hard to imagine the provocateur who published spurious outtakes of The Death of a President that had LBJ having sex with JFK's corpse being mellowed out enough to write this affectionate memoir of his countercultural life and times. Much of the fun here comes from sharing Krassner's gallery of famous friends, limned in generally crisp portraits and starting with publisher Lyle Stuart, who in 1958 bankrolled The Realist; Stuart's then-employer, Bill Gaines of Mad; and, a bit later, comic/junkie Lenny Bruce. As The Realist's fame grew, so did Krassner's circle, which came to encompass Groucho Marx (who took LSD with the author and soared on Bach); Abbie Hoffman (gutsy, wired) and Jerry Rubin (with whom Krassner formed the Yippie Party); Ken Kesey, Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, John Lennon; Manson-slaves Sandra Good and Squeaky Fromme (who nearly seduced Krassner into a m&#x201a;nage ... trois); and Larry Flynt (who in the late 70's hired Krassner as publisher of Hustler). Also nostalgia-worthy are Krassner's sepia-tinged memoirs of his N.Y.C. childhood (especially a humorous run-in with a dwarf at Coney Island) and of his first glimmers of the absurd. More personal-emotional and less interesting are his recollections of his paranoid breakdown in the 70's, and, a decade later, of his grappling with his daughter's sexual awakening; more scattered are his most recent memories, of reviving The Realist and joining the 60's Memory Lane circuit. There's little of the edgy naughtiness here that, at its peak, had Krassner publish an infamous cartoon of Disney characters at an orgy; what's taken its place is an engaging avuncular impishness that Krassner wears well--and even with dignity. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) (First serial to Playboy and High Times) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Krassner's satirical journal, <i>The Realist</i>, was one of the most important counterculture magazines of the 1960s. At a time when iconoclasm became the norm in American society, <i>The Realist</i> never faltered at staying jumps ahead of the shifting standards of acceptability. As outrageous as Krassner's articles were, they were always written to be strangely believable. Thus, an authentic-sounding account of Lyndon Johnson practicing necrophilia on John Kennedy's corpse was just one story that caused quite an uproar. The key element in Krassner's satiric success was his ability to keep imaginatively focused upon how ordinary people might react to a world out of order. This grasp on the depths of human feelings makes these memoirs enjoyable to read, too. Moreover, chapters on such friends and cohorts as Lenny Bruce and Abbie Hoffman greatly flesh out the personalities of the 1960s pop-cultural revolution. Krassner also recalls his own personal anecdotes, stretching from childhood days as a violin prodigy to dropping LSD with Groucho Marx, with considerable shrewdness. Even as ridiculing the sacred seems bound to become a time-honored American tradition, Krassner's <i>Confessions</i> reminds us how and where it all began. <i>Aaron Cohen</i></p><h2>The Great Global Warming Blunder: How Mother Nature Fooled the World&#39;s Top Climate Scientists (Encounter Broadsides)</h2><p>The Great Global Warming Blunder unveils new evidence from major scientific findings that explode the conventional wisdom on climate change and reshape the global warming debate as we know it. Roy W. Spencer, a former senior NASA climatologist, reveals how climate researchers have mistaken cause and effect when analyzing cloud behavior and have been duped by Mother Nature into believing the Earth&#x2019;s climate system is far more sensitive to human activities and carbon dioxide than it really is.<br> <br>In fact, Spencer presents astonishing new evidence that recent warming is not the fault of humans, but the result of chaotic, internal natural cycles that have been causing periods of warming and cooling for millennia. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not necessarily to be feared; The Great Global Warming Blunder explains that burning of fossil fuels may actually be beneficial for life on Earth.<br> <br>As group-think behavior and misguided global warming policy proposals threaten the lives of millions of the world&#x2019;s poorest, most vulnerable citizens, The Great Global Warming Blunder is a scintillating exposï¿½ and much-needed call for debate.<br></p><p>Roy W. Spencer is a Principal Research Scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He was formerly a Senior Scientist for Climate Studies at NASA.

Reprint.</p><p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p>Ray Bradbury, the current master of science fiction, narrates his semi-autobiographical novel of his visit to Ireland to work with director John Huston on the script of &#34;Moby Dick.&#34; This fast-paced audio is a tour de force; Bradbury brings verbal images of Ireland to life with no effort at all. He also brings off the real life vocal style of Huston so believably that you think Huston came back from the grave to record this. The piece flows due to the author&#39;s familiarity with the text. While the packaging looks unprofessional, the audio work inside is more than exceptional. B.P.

In our time, the hygienic necessity of bathing and cleanliness is a foregone conclusion. Most of us bathe regularly and pride ourselves on clean living. The problem is that many of us bathe for cleanliness only, letting the more aesthetic aspects of the bath go down the drain. It is our intention not to dwell on the obvious hygienic necessity of bathing, but instead to emphasize the delights and pleasures of the bath. Our accelerated pace of living leaves us little time for a tranquil soak in a hot tub. Moreover, bathing has become a chore; a bothersome task, squeezed in between 5:l5 and cocktails. The leisurely, relaxing bath is being abandoned in favor of the quick, invigorating shower. We would suggest a compromise wherein the bath and the shower both be utilized for their unique advantages. Just as the shower has it place in the scheme of things, so should the bath be afforded the time it so richly deserves. Or, put another way, you should afford yourself the time you so richly deserve. We hope by increasing your knowledge and awareness of the bath, to enhance your enjoyment of it. Steep your body in a steaming tub, float away tensions, drown anxieties, relax...enjoy.</p><p></p><h2>John Bull!: 150 years a locomotive</h2><p>Written by John White, noted railroad historian and Curator of Transportation for the Smithsonian, this book is a complete biography of one of the very first American steam locomotives, the John Bull.

S. Eliot, and others. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>Never has one character of the stage provoked such controversy or achieved such infamy as Shakespeare&#39;s enigmatic Shylock. For four centuries the money lender of &#34;The Merchant of Venice&#34; has been reinvented as both villain and victim, as an object of tragedy and comedy, and has been used as an economic symbol and often as a lightning rod for anti-Semitism. But what was Shakespeare&#39;s attitude toward the character described on the play&#39;s title page in 1600 as &#34;a man of extreme crueltie&#34;, and what should be our own? With brilliant historical perspective and insight, theater critic John Gross explores the complex and influential history that has given Shylock a life beyond the play and established him as a figure of world mythology. Illuminating Shylock&#39;s evolution on the stage, his importance to writers and psychologists, and his enduring influence on society and culture, John Gross sheds as much light on our own shifting attitudes and beliefs as on the rich and disquieting figure Shakespeare created.Shylock--stereotype, archetype, icon--is, according to London Sunday Telegram theater-critic Gross (The Rise and Fall of the Man of Letters), the only character in a Shakespeare play to have an autonomous life. By tracing Shylock's origins and forms in literature, theater, and political and social history, Gross emphasizes his chameleonlike nature and what it reveals about the cultures in which he appears. An object of fun, contempt, pity, and rage, Shylock first appeared as the ``Satanic Jew''--the evil figure to be overcome--in The Merchant of Venice, written between 1596-98. An archetypal usurer with origins in folklore, politics, and popular culture, he embodied, says Gross, the era's ambiguities toward Jews, money, misers, and, on another level, toward emerging Economic Man, embodied in Shylock as a tough-minded businessman caught up in the court system and unable to protect his family or what he perceives as his rights. In the 18th century, Shylock was played as a clown, or as wolfish and cunning, until Edmund Kean's consummate interpretation in his London debut in 1814, a performance admired and immortalized by Hazlitt for the sympathy it evoked. A Victorian interpretation by Henry Irving displayed a Shylock possessed, the victim of persecution. Since then, Gross contends, literary critics from A.C. Bradley to Mark Van Doren, novelists from Sir Walter Scott to James Joyce, social theorists including Ruskin and Marx, psychologists from Freud to Reich, and all the great actors- -Gielgud, O'Toole, Olivier--have contributed to the evolution of a subtle, conflicted, mysterious Shylock who has acquired the archetypal dimensions of a Don Quixote or Robinson Crusoe. A lucid, perceptive, and learned guide that makes the familiar interesting and the esoteric familiar. A new incarnation for Shylock. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Howard and Conan: The Final Years (2001, essay) by Stephen Jones.</p><p>Of the 21 Conan the Barbarian tales that Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) completed in his all-too-brief lifetime, <i>Hour of the Dragon</i> was the only novel-length story. It may also be the very best of the series, crafted when the legendary pulp writer was working at the height of his powers. Conan is a huge swordsman fighting both natural and supernatural foes in a time-lost world known as the Hyborian Age. At this point in his bloody career, Conan is the middle-aged king of the ancient kingdom of Aquilonia. He must fight one final battle to save the known world from a resurrected sorcerer named Xaltotun. Only the fabled Heart of Ahriman can destroy Xaltotun, and Conan must embark on an epic quest to retrieve the Heart. Howard hammered out every word as if he had actually lived through it himself, and in doing so forged a crimson masterpiece of heroic fantasy. (This novel has also been published as part of the formal Conan series as <i>Conan the Conqueror</i>.) <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems: Sleeping, Feeding, and Behavior- Beyond The Basics From Infancy Through Toddlerhood</h2><p>Goes beyond the basics presented in the author&#39;s first two child-care guides to offer a series of specific, targeted strategies for solving common challenges faced by parents of children up to three years of age, including feeding problems, sleep troubles, and behavior issues, in a volume complemented by real-life case stories. 125,000 first printi</p><p>Tracy Hogg<b> </b>devoted her twenty-five-year career to helping parents understand and communicate with their babies and young children.

Each displays a unique, compelling insider&#x2019;s view of criminal behavior, which comes from his long background as a criminal defense attorney who has handled thirty murder cases. Winner of the Distinguished Northwest Writer Award, he lives in Portland, Oregon.</p>Amanda Jaffe, the Oregon defense attorney, is defending a homeless man accused of murder, while her father, Frank, is representing a mobster on a similar charge. Although both men profess their innocence, the forensic evidence says otherwise. But when Amanda starts examining the evidence in these two unconnected cases, she finds a frightening common denominator. The third Jaffe novel--after <i>Wild Justice</i> (2000) and <i>Ties That Bind</i> (2003)--is an examination of the role of forensic evidence in bringing criminals to justice. In addition to a fast-moving plot and characters who at least hold up their end of the bargain, Margolin shows readers how a crime-scene investigator can easily--and often without detection--not only influence the outcome of a trial but also effectively ensure a certain verdict. It's typical of Margolin to use the legal-thriller subgenre to explore some socially significant aspect of the jury system. The increasing popularity of forensic fiction and of <i>CSI</i>,<i></i> the television series that has become a cottage industry, virtually guarantees this novel a wide and appreciative audience. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

As a child, he learned English by listening to American pop and watching action films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. When U.S. marines landed in Mogadishu to take on the warlords, Abdi cheered the arrival of these Americans, who seemed as heroic as those of the movies.<br><br> Sporting American clothes and dance moves, he became known around Mogadishu as Abdi American, but when the radical Islamist group al-Shabaab rose to power in 2006, it became dangerous to celebrate Western culture. Desperate to make a living, Abdi used his language skills to post secret dispatches, which found an audience of worldwide listeners. Eventually, though, Abdi was forced to flee to Kenya.<br><br> In an amazing stroke of luck, Abdi won entrance to the U.S. in the annual visa lottery, though his route to America did not come easily. Parts of his story were first heard on the&nbsp;BBC World Service&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>This American Life.&nbsp;</i>Now a proud resident of Maine, on the path to citizenship, Abdi Nor Iftin's dramatic, deeply stirring memoir is truly a story for our time: a vivid reminder of why America still beckons to those looking to make a better life.</p><p>Abdi Nor Iftin&nbsp;currently lives in Maine. He is studying political science at the University of Southern Maine, and he plays soccer every Saturday in a melting-pot league of Americans and immigrants from around the world.<p>Excerpted from Chapter Five: Arabic to English<br><br>By December of 1992, the world could no longer sit back and watch the starvation in Somalia. Humanitarian aid had been coming in for months but the warlords grabbed all the food and medicine for themselves and gave none to the people. The situation got worse until finally the United Nations decided to take action. Led by the U.S., twenty-eight countries organized a military task force called Operation Restore Hope. The goal was to supervise the distribution of food and supplies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In Somalia we call Americans <i>Mareekan</i>. When I heard these <i>Mareekan</i> were coming to Mogadishu, I asked my mom who they were. I didn&#x2019;t know the people in the action movies were <i>Mareekan</i>. &#x201c;They are huge, strong, white people,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They eat pork, drink wine, and have dogs in their houses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This sounded like the people I had seen in the movies. Whoever they were, the militias looked worried about their arrival. Many rebels started burying their guns; some fled Mogadishu. There was confusion and tension everywhere. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to see <i>Mareekans</i> land in Mogadishu! Hopefully they would look like actors in the movies and would spray bullets all over the militias.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And so at midnight on December 9, the thunderous roar of Cobra helicopters and AC-130 gunships filled the air. From the ocean came the buzz of hovercrafts, unloading tanks and Marines onto the beach. Our house was close to the airport and the sea, so all these sounds woke me up right away. Through the bullet holes in our roof I could see the gleaming lights of the planes, accompanied by the roar of tanks along the roads. My mother, Hassan and Khadija were all up, even Nima.<br><br>I was eager to see the troops and the helicopters in the morning. At dawn Hassan and I, holding hands, walked down to the airport past streets that used to have sniper nests. There were lots of Somalis in the street, all of them headed the same way, towards the airport. As we got closer, the sounds of the Cobra attack helicopters became deafening. We joined a group of other excited Somalis, some standing on the walls, others on top of roofs, watching as big Chinook heavy-lift copters took off and landed. We could see warships in the distance on the blue ocean; everywhere around the airport, Marines in camouflage were taking positions and setting up gun posts.<br> Someone said the <i>Mareekans</i> had rounded up the rebels who were controlling the airport and seaport. The crowd got bigger and bigger, we shouted, laughed and cheered in excitement. Security perimeters had already set up, blocking entrances to the airport. The <i>Mareekan</i> flag was waving, stars and stripes. That&#x2019;s when it hit me: <i>I had seen that flag in movies!</i> These <i>Mareekans</i> were the movie people, and this was a real movie happening in front of us!<br><br>Commando must be here, I thought. This is it. This is the moment I had been waiting for, to meet Commando and watch him blow away all the militias! Helicopters dropped a shower of leaflets with photos and information about the troops. I picked up several of them. &#x201c;United Nations forces are here to assist in the international relief effort for the Somali people,&#x201d; it said in Somali. &#x201c;We are prepared to use force to protect the relief operation and our soldiers. We will not allow interference with food distribution or with our activities. We are here to help you.&#x201d; Because not so many Somalis could read, the leaflets also showed an illustration like a comic book of a U.S. soldier shaking hands with a Somali man under a palm tree, as a helicopter flew past. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to shake hands with Commando.<br><br>Everything was moving so quickly&#x2014;the tanks, the soldiers, the planes. We jostled for positions to watch the movie that was happening in front of us. Except there was no gunfire. I kept waiting for the battle to start, I wanted the Chinooks and Cobras to blast away at the rebels. But everything was peaceful. Then I remembered it&#x2019;s always like this in the movies. First you see all the heavy machines and helicopters gearing up for action, then the battle comes later. I wanted to see the militias face these troops, but the rebels I had known since we returned to Mogadishu were now walking around unarmed, acting like regular people. They didn&#x2019;t dare to face Commando.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>I watched all day as the Marines took positions, more and more of them coming. Two men in uniform waved to let us cross the airport runway up to the sand dunes, so we could watch as the hovercrafts brought more and more Marines from the sea. Humvees and tanks roamed noisily but never fired a shot. I was getting impatient for the battle to start. We watched as the troops pulled out their stuck Humvees from the sand dunes. Hassan and I grew bolder and edged close to the troops. I stood there with my mouth open, watching them drink from a water bottle and smile at us. I made a sign asking for water, and the white guy in uniform went into the Humvee and handed me a plastic bottle. Then we made eating signs with our hands to our mouths, and they handed us tasty marmalade, bread and butter. The Commando lookalikes even spoke to us in Somali, but all they could say was <i>&#x201c;Somali Siko!&#x201d;</i> Somali move back!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>One of the Marines threw a chocolate candy to me. I grabbed it and swallowed the whole thing. When I got home and told Mom, she gave me a hard slap.<br><br>&#x201c;You must not eat pork!&#x201d; she said.<br><br>I told her I didn&#x2019;t think it was pork, it was sweet, but she didn&#x2019;t believe me. How would she know what pork tastes like?<br><br>Night came again, and Mogadishu was noisier than I had ever heard it. But for the first time in two years, there was no sound of explosions and gunfire. We were surprised how the Marines lit up the airport. Lights came from everywhere, helicopters, tents, cars. It looked like daytime in the middle of the night. We were not allowed to get too close to the airport at night<i>&#x2014;&#x201c;Somali Siko!&#x201d;</i> the Marines yelled over and over. But for the first time my friends, my brother and I could go out on the dusty streets after dark and play games, laugh and talk. We counted the helicopters as they flew over, and the big gunships that circled over the city. Falis&#x2019;s movie theater could now stay open at night, but we did not go. For the first time in years, outside was even more exciting than the movies.<br><br>***<br><br>The year had changed to 1993, my ninth year of life. The U.S. troops and the star-spangled banner were now accompanied by blue UN helmets and flags of countries from all over Asia, Africa and Europe. Many non-military people also came to the city to help. We would see them jogging, and swimming in the green waters off the beach. One woman, some kind of aid worker, jogged every morning near our house. She was white, had long hair, and she smiled and remembered my name. I made sure to get up every morning and say hi to her when she passed. I watched her listening to music on her headphones and stretching. Sometimes she would sit and play games with me, my brother and Nima. She always brought us snacks like peanuts, candies and cookies, and she also brought painkillers, antibiotics and other medicine. We had never seen pills, so she explained what they were for, and how to take them. I think I fell in love with this women, it wasn&#x2019;t romantic but I just wanted to stay close to her. If I knew her name today, maybe I could find her in America, but I only called her what we called all non-Muslims, <i>gaalo</i> or infidel. One day she came to the <i>madrassa</i>, just to visit and say hi. Macalin Basbaas refused to shake her hand. Then one day we stopped seeing her. Soon we realized no one was jogging anymore.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The warlords were getting restless, they wanted the city back. Aidid had a radio station and was telling Somalis on the air that they should fight the &#x201c;occupation&#x201d; of Mogadishu. On June 5, UN forces went to the radio station to seize weapons. Aidid thought they were trying to shut down the broadcasts and he ambushed the troops, killing twenty-four Pakistani soldiers. That&#x2019;s when things got bad. On July 12 the Americans sent Cobras over a house in Mogadishu where they thought Aidid was hiding and blasted it into rubble. He wasn&#x2019;t there, but dozens of other people were killed. Aidid claimed the Americans had killed women and children, and he started to whip up Somalis against the infidel &#x201c;invaders.&#x201d; The Americans said only Aidid&#x2019;s soldiers had been in the house, but the seed of resentment against the foreigners had been planted. Aidid wasted no time, planting roadside bombs in August that killed four American soldiers and wounded seven others. The Battle of Mogadishu had begun.<br><br>I had been waiting so long for this moment! I wanted to see the American troops in action and how they fight. Hassan and I were so excited for war, we ran toward whatever corner of the city we heard explosions or gunshots. Soon Cobras and Black Hawks were swooping down everywhere, hovering over buildings where militias were hiding. I looked up and cheered whenever the helicopters shot at a building, to me it seemed like the greatest movie. I stood on the streets and watched militias yell at each other, jumping from house to house and hiding in narrow alleys. We watched them take positions as helicopters hovered over them.<br><br> I thought the airplanes and helicopters would scare the militias away, but instead the huge, strong American men of the movies were being chased by Somali rebels on the streets. It was not what I expected. Soon everything had changed. We were no longer welcome near the Marines, there were no more candies or cookies. For the first time the Marines were aiming their guns at Somalis and pushing them around, even us kids. They looked nervous. <br><br> It is hard to explain why so many Mogadishans turned against the Marines and cheered the militias. The rebels had been killing us for four years, stealing our food and shitting in our houses. The Americans had been so kind. For sure it was partly the U.S. attack on the house that killed so many civilians. And at this point we were so familiar with death and destruction that this new battle seemed like a basketball game or a soccer match, it wasn&#x2019;t even real life. People filled the streets, rooting for their home team. I too fell in with the crowd. I yelled out to the militias to let them know which side the helicopter was coming from. I threw rocks at helicopters. I ran with the crowd, repeating their cheers: &#x201c;Up with Aidid! Down with America!&#x201d;<br><br>The battle continued for weeks. The foreign troops slowly withdrew to the airport. Militias loyal to Aidid ruled the ground, but the foreign troops ruled the skies with their helicopters. At night it was hard for the Somali militias to see, but the helicopters with their infrared lasers were able to fire at their targets. Every night from our house I watched militias changing positions, shooting at helicopters. For a few minutes it would be dead quiet, then the helicopter would swoop down again and fire back. I believed my mother&#x2019;s prayers saved us from the helicopter cannons but now I think it was the pilots&#x2019; precision.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>On Sunday October 3, Aidid&#x2019;s forces shot down two Black Hawk helicopters with Russian RPG bazookas. I heard the booming explosions and columns of smoke rising about a mile from our house. Naturally, I ran as fast as I could to watch this new action unfold. Everything was so dusty I could not see much or get very close. A crowd was dragging the bodies of dead Americans, and people said others were still alive, trapped. The rescue operation lasted until the next day. Sixteen Americans died and more than three hundred Somalis. A few days later I was playing hide and seek in the remains of one of the Black Hawks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five months later the Americans left Mogadishu. It was March 1994, my tenth year. The skinny rebels with their ugly brown teeth had beaten back the movie-star Marines. The Americans and the UN troops left so fast they didn&#x2019;t even take their stuff. They left behind malfunctioning helicopters and vehicles, boots and uniforms. I joined a crowd that went to the same spot where the <i>Mareekans</i> had first invited us to watch them land on the beach in hovercrafts. This time we were looting the stuff they left behind, even the boxes of medicines, tablets, discarded syringes. We stuck the syringes into our hands for fun. We ate the tablets. Was it looting if they just left it? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The same militias whom we had cheered against the foreigners would soon turn on us again&#x2014;stealing our food and shooting at us for sport. I felt shame that I had cheered against the Americans, the people who came to help us from the country of my dreams. But I now realize that I was lost&#x2014;a nine-year-old boy caught between the teachings of Macalin Basbaas, my mother and her view on infidels, the American troops and their kindness and food, my love for my brave father and the glorious Somali basketball team, and the American movies I loved.<br><br>I stood on the beach, picking through the discarded camouflage uniforms with the American names sewn above the pockets. I held them up, hoping one would fit my skinny little body. My friends Mohammed, Bashi and Bocow laughed. I looked at them and scowled.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not Somali,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I am <i>Mareekan</i>. I was left behind by the Marines. And they will come for me soon.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Islam&#39;s Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora</h2><p>A pioneering history of the Eastern slave trade<br><br>In this groundbreaking work intended as a companion volume to <i>The Black Diaspora</i>, Ronald Segal tells the fascinating and horrifying story of the Islamic slave trade. Documenting a centuries-old institution that still survives today, Islam's Black Slaves outlines the differences between the trades in the East and West. Slaves in Islam, for example, were kept mainly in the service sector as cooks, porters, soldiers, and concubines, and while the Atlantic trade valued men over women, the Eastern trade preferred women, in numbers as high as two to one. Tracing slavery through history, from Islam's inception in the seventh century, across China, India, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Libya, Spain, and the Sudan and Morocco, which still have active markets, Segal reveals for the first time the extent of the trade and the sheer number of slaves-as many as twelve million-bought and sold in the course of the subsequent centuries. In an illuminating conclusion, Segal addresses the popularity of Islam in African American communities. <i>Islam's Black Slaves</i> is a pioneering account of this often unacknowledged tradition and a riveting cross-cultural commentary.<br></p><p>Founding editor of the Penguin African Library, South African-born <b>Ronald Segal</b> is the author of fourteen books, including <i>The Crisis of India</i>, <i>The Race War</i>, <i>The Americans</i>, and <i>The Black Diaspora</i> (FSG, 1995). He lives in Surrey, England.<br>Designed as a companion volume to Segal's The Black Diaspora, which traced the movements of blacks in the Western Hemisphere from the Atlantic slave trade to the present, this book undertakes the formidable task of recounting the dispersion of black Africans in Asia and the Middle East, most of which was forced by the Islamic slave trade. "In Islam, slavery was never the moral, political, and economic issue that it was in the West, so there are fewer sources about its history," notes Segal, the founding editor of the Penguin African Library and the author of 14 other books. Still, he pieces together a compelling drama of conquests and conversions, beginning with an illuminating chapter about the differences between the Atlantic and Islamic trades: the Islamic trade began some eight centuries before the Atlantic one, and preferred women slaves over men. His account then moves from early Islam, when laws did not subject slaves to any special racial discrimination, into the 19th century, when the process of enslaving blacks came to involve violence and brutality on a gigantic scale. Segal also discusses the extension of the Islamic trade into China, India and Spain, the role of the Ottoman Empire, slavery in Iran and Libya, and the effect of European colonization, which he argues "preserved the force if not the face of old subjugations." A preliminary dig in a little-explored area, this book has a rough-hewn quality about it; scholars may find it too general, even if it provides seeds for further study. General readers, however, will find much that is new, particularly in the early chapters, where Segal trains his eye on the part slaves played in the development of the high civilization attained by imperial Islam. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Mutiny on the Bounty: A saga of sex, sedition, mayhem and mutiny, and survival against extraordinary odds</h2><p><br>The mutiny on HMS <i>Bounty</i>, in the South Pacific on 28 April 1789, is one of history's truly great stories - a tale of human drama, intrigue and adventure of the highest order - and in the hands of Peter FitzSimons it comes to life as never before.<br><br>Commissioned by the Royal Navy to collect breadfruit plants from Tahiti and take them to the West Indies, the <i>Bounty</i>'s crew found themselves in a tropical paradise. Five months later, they did not want to leave. Under the leadership of Fletcher Christian most of the crew mutinied soon after sailing from Tahiti, setting Captain William Bligh and 18 loyal crewmen adrift in a small open boat. In one of history's great feats of seamanship, Bligh navigated this tiny vessel for 3618 nautical miles to Timor.<br><br>Fletcher Christian and the mutineers sailed back to Tahiti, where most remained and were later tried for mutiny. But Christian, along with eight fellow mutineers and some Tahitian men and women, sailed off into the unknown, eventually discovering the isolated Pitcairn Island - at the time not even marked on British maps - and settling there.<br><br>This astonishing story is historical adventure at its very best, encompassing the mutiny, Bligh's monumental achievement in navigating to safety, and Fletcher Christian and the mutineers' own epic journey from the sensual paradise of Tahiti to the outpost of Pitcairn Island. The mutineers' descendants live on Pitcairn to this day, amid swirling stories and rumours of past sexual transgressions and present-day repercussions. <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i> is a sprawling, dramatic tale of intrigue, bravery and sheer boldness, told with the accuracy of historical detail and total command of story that are Peter FitzSimons' trademarks.</p><p>Peter FitzSimons is Australia's bestselling non-fiction writer, and for the past 30 years has also been a journalist and columnist with the SYDNEY MORNING HERALD and the SUN-HERALD.<br><br>He is the author of a number of highly successful books, including BURKE AND WILLS, MONASH'S MASTERPIECE, KOKODA, NED KELLY and GALLIPOLI, as well as biographies of such notable Australians as Sir Douglas Mawson, Nancy Wake and Nick Farr-Jones.

It&#39;s a book of considerable caring and expertise - a book to affirm our deeper values more openly and in daily life, with practical herbal remedies and recipes for healthy body, mind and spirit.

Scenes from the daily lives of various animals illuminate the changes in flora and fauna that occurred during the Mesozoic era.<p> The fossil record offers some clues about dinosaur behavior. Tracks preserved in sandstone indicate that some of the huge Diplodocus-type dinosaurs traveled in herds with the larger individuals on the outside and the smaller, more vulnerable animals in the center. The courtship behavior of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, the social hierarchy within the <i>Diplodocus</i> herd, etc., described in the book are pure speculation. But Haines models his descriptions on animals that occupy similar niches today: <i>Tapejara</i>, a fish-eating pterosaur, nests in remote colonies, like a migratory seabird. However, the suggestion that an old <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suffered from gout is based on a hotly debated interpretation of the markings on bones of the "Sue" fossil in Chicago's Field Museum.</p><p> The striking visuals for the program involved a combination of animatronic figures, puppets, and computer animation. The images work well as illustrations. The formally posed animals in many old paintings had a taxidermic stiffness; these creatures are shown in motion, often in slightly awkward poses, which heightens the illusion that <i>Walking with Dinosaurs</i> is a book of nature photographs.</p><p> The result is a highly readable introduction to current theories about dinosaurs that amateur scientists of all ages can enjoy. <i>--Charles Solomon</i></p>Tim Haines studied zoology at Bangor University before pursuing a career in scientific journalism. He has written extensively for newspapers, World Service Radio, and for the BBC television series Nature, one of the most widely enjoyed of all programs on American Public Television.

For novices, orchestrating The Feast is no easy task. And even for old pros it's a bit of a challenge. Enter The Thanksgiving Table: the lowdown on the how to. Everything from the foolproof secret to a moist bird and how to truss and carve it to menu suggestions and simple, elegant table settings. Plus, recipes for classics like cranberry relish as well as more innovative dishes--and a whole section devoted to vegetarians. And maybe best of all, do-ahead tips and plenty of food and technique photographs to make planning in advance a breeze. The Thanksgiving Table is a kitchen essential--a book for which every home cook can give thanks.</p><p></p></p><p>Diane Morgan is an experienced teacher and author of several cookbooks including Cooking for the Week.

They are instead guides to creating updated classics such as Gratin of Fennel and Tomato, and Acorn Squash Stuffed with Wild Rice, Cranberries, Walnuts and Hickory-Baked Tofu. In deference to the holiday, instructions for advance preparations and shortcuts are provided: for Lasagna with Sugar Pumpkin, Ricotta, and Fried Sage Leaves, for example, Morgan explains how to substitute fresh pasta or no-boil lasagna noodles. A chapter on turkey provides instructions for buying and handling the bird, as well as recipes for Barbecued Turkey and a simple Roast Turkey Breast for a Small Gathering. There are even a few vegetarian entr&#x201a;es, including Spaghetti Squash with Zucchini, Garlic, and Tomato Sauce. The dishes here are new, but never so adventurous that they would be inappropriate for a traditional holiday celebration. Stuffing ideas include Italian Sausage, Mushroom and Sage Stuffing, and Chestnut, Leek, and Fresh Herb Bread Pudding. Desserts play on classic Thanksgiving flavors: Chocolate Gingerbread with Sugar-Glazed Apples, and Pumpkin Cheesecake with a Gingersnap Crumb Crust. A chapter on using leftover turkey offers Turkey Potpie with a Biscuit Crust, and Turkey Enchiladas. Menus for variously sized parties and clever ideas like miniature pumpkins cut to encase votive candles round out this spot-on effort. (Nov.)Forecast: This is an incredibly useful little book.

Their bold, energetic, and encouraging vision for psychoanalytic treatment combines elements of developmental psychology, attachment theory, and psychoanalytic technique. Drawing extensively on case studies and recent analytic literature to illustrate their ideas, Fonagy, Gergely, Jurist, and Target offer models of psychotherapy practice that can enable the gradual development of mentalization and affect regulation even in patients with long histories of violence or neglect.<br> <br> Provides an exhaustive review of psychoanalytic and developmental psychological research. Employs a truly impressive array of detailed and engaging case studies. Puts forth a comprehensive theory for the way in which the abilities to mentalize (make and use mental representations of your own and other people's emotional states) and affect regulate (control one's own emotions as is appropriate to environment) can determine a person's successful development. Discusses the ways in which bad or insufficient parenting can leave children unable to modulate and interpret their own feelings, as well as the feelings of those around them. Considers the implications for personality disorders and general psychological problems of self-confidence, etc. Evaluates the role of psychoanalytic therapy in addressing this problem in patients, by teaching them in later life to develop these cognitive/emotional capabilities.</p><p><b>Peter Fonagy, Ph.D., F.B.A</b>., is Freud Memorial Professor of Psychoanalysis and Director of the Sub-Department of Clinical Health Psychology at Univesity College London. <br><br><b>Gyorgy Gergely, Ph.D.</b>, is Director of the Developmental Psychology Laboratory of the Psychology Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. <br><br><b>Mary Target, Ph.D.</b>, is a Senior Lecturer in Psychoanalysis at University College London.<br><br><b>Elliot L.

Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor-the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. <br>Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in "The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in "The Return of the King.<br>In the First Part of The Lord of the Rings, 111-year-old Bilbo Baggins (hero of The Hobbit) passed along his magical ring to his orphaned nephew, Frodo--unwittingly setting its original owner, the horrible Gollum, on his trail. Lest the ring fall into evil hands, Frodo sought to destroy it at the Mountain of Fire in the enemy land of Mordor. He convened the Companions of the Ring to carry out this perilous mission, but his brave band has been scattered, beset by orc-soldiers, and in the Second Part, as &#39;the great Darkness&#39; descends, Frodo himself has mysteriously disappeared.</p><h2>The Message of Exodus: The Days of Our Pilgrimage</h2><p>When the Lord promised the land of Canaan to Abram and his descendants (Gen 15:7), every part of it was already occupied by other peoples. The long journey to possession of the Promised Land was prepared by God, yet it led through a path of adversity. We, the readers of the Old Testament, are left to wonder why. In this engaging commentary on Exodus, J. Alec Motyer explores the character of God through his covenant promises and persistent faithfulness to the people of Israel. Through the story of Israel we are exposed to an unquenchable fire: God the Savior, the Companion and the Indweller, who will not fail those who so often fail him.</p><p>J.

His books include <em>The Prophecy of Isaiah</em>, and he was the Old Testament editor of The Bible Speaks Today commentary series.&#34;Motyer is largely successful in making the book of Exodus speak today. Motyer has clearly grappled with the Hebrew text in preparing his expositions, and thus his expositions are grounded on a scholarly analysis of the text.&#34; (Stone Campbell Journal, Spring 2007)</p><h2>Arne &amp; Carlos Greatest Knits</h2><p>Beloved Scandinavian craft design duo Arne &amp; Carlos are celebrating 15 years of Christmas balls, Easter eggs, scarves, hats, socks, slippers, sweaters, jackets, and so much more - and you're invited!

As a soldier, he's fought them. But nothing prepared him for the surreal mix of desperation and hope he encountered when he returned to Zimbabwe, his broken homeland. <br><br>Godwin arrived as Robert Mugabe, the country's dictator for 30 years, has finally lost an election. Mugabe's tenure has left Zimbabwe with the world's highest rate of inflation and the shortest life span. Instead of conceding power, Mugabe launched a brutal campaign of terror against his own citizens. With foreign correspondents banned, and he himself there illegally, Godwin was one of the few observers to bear witness to this period the locals call The Fear. He saw torture bases and the burning villages but was most awed as an observer of not only simple acts of kindness but also churchmen and diplomats putting their own lives on the line to try to stop the carnage.<br><br>THE FEAR is a book about the astonishing courage and resilience of a people, armed with nothing but a desire to be free, who challenged a violent dictatorship. It is also the deeply personal and ultimately uplifting story of a man trying to make sense of the country he can't recognize as home.</p><p><b>Peter Godwin</b> is the award-winning author of <em>When a Crocodile Eats the Sun</em> and<em> Mukiwa</em>. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, he was educated at Cambridge and Oxford and became a foreign correspondent, reporting from more than 60 countries. Since moving to Manhattan, he has written for <em>National Geographic, </em>the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, and <i>Vanity Fair. </i>He has taught at Princeton and Columbia<i>, </i>and in 2010 received a Guggenheim fellowship."<i>The Fear</i> is an important book detailing the violent realities, the grotesque injustices, the hunger, the sadness, and a portrait of Mugabe, the tyrant who is the cause of it all. Godwin is passionate and personal, as well as bold in his travel and scrupulous in his documentation."&#x2015;<b><i>Paul Theroux, author of <i>Ghost Train to the Eastern Star</i></i></b><br><br>"There is nothing on the subject of Robert Mugabe's terror state that comes even close to Peter Godwin's brilliant account. It took great courage to pursue this horror at close range, as Godwin did. This book will change utterly readers' perceptions of what is happening in this afflicted corner of Africa."&#x2015;<b><i>Norman Rush, author of <i>Mating</i> and <i>Mortals</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Fear</i> is an urgent and essential book: a stunning account of a dictator's determination to destroy his people, and of his people's refusal to be destroyed. Written in the teeth of devastation and despair, without recourse to sentimentality or false hope, it is a heroic account of political heroism -- and it makes for relentlessly gripping reading."&#x2015;<b><i>Philip Gourevitch, author of <i>We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families</i></i></b><br><br>"A feat of fearless reporting, this shattering story is not only an expose of the horrors of political violence, but a testament to the astonishing courage of ordinary citizens in the face of evil."&#x2015;<b><i>Melanie Thernstrom, author of <i>The Pain Chronicles</i></i></b><br><br>"Peter Godwin's latest book is the most powerful indictment of Robert Mugabe's regime yet written, marking out the author as one of the sharpest observers of modern Africa."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Economist</em></i></b><br><br>"Given Godwin's steady gaze back toward his home country over the past decade and a half, it is tempting to categorize <i>The Fear</i> as a sequel to his memoirs, but this work is too uncompromising and fierce for that.... the result is his most powerful work to date.... Godwin gives the rest of the world a reason to act. He argues that justice is not only possible in Zimbabwe, it is essential."&#x2015;<b>Alexandra Fuller</b>, <b><i><em>Harper's</em></i></b><br><br>"mesmerizing.... When a writer with such powers sets out to break your heart, you had best be prepared to have it broken. But <em>The Fear</em> is far more than a catalog of human rights violations and tragedy, in no small part due to the astonishing courage and determination of the Zimbabweans Godwin interviewed. Even those left cold by the usual run of "inspirational" literature will find these stories stirring."&#x2015;<b>Laura Miller</b>, <b><i>Salon</i></b><br><br>"<i>The Fear</i> is utterly fearless....incredibly vivid and haunting and, sadly, timely."&#x2015;<b>James Zug</b>, <b><i><em>The Boston Globe</em></i></b><br><br>"<i>The Fear</i> is a gut-wrenching portrait of Mugabe's enormous political sadism --and the brave, heartbreaking, nearly superhuman resistance to it.... In the hands of a less talented writer, <i>The Fear</i> could have become simply too painful to read. But while Godwin spares us nothing, he writes with such compassion, poetry and ironic humor that you cannot put his book down.... <i>The Fear</i> is a visceral masterpiece. It's illuminating, infuriating and informative. And its implications extend far beyond Zimbabwe --to the northern end of the continent and beyond, where similar struggles are being waged against other tyrannical dictators. <i>The Fear</i> is as important a book as we can read right now.

Jessica Nelson, an ambitious intern at the local newspaper, the Pecan Springs Enterprise, has both professional and personal reasons for aggressively chasing an obvious arson homicide story. When Jessica disappears, a puzzled China retraces Jessica's steps, but is wise enough to keep police chief Sheila Dawson and Sheriff Blackie Blackwell in the loop. China's 11-year-old niece, Caitlin, and flamboyant friend Ruby Wilcox lend a hand.

Initially the castings are finished by simple hand methods, but it isn&#39;t long before the developing machines are doing much of the work to produce their own parts. It does not take long to learn the simple craft of pattern-making and sand molding. Each phase of the projects increase your knowledge and skill. There is no need to look for outside help. You can do it all in your own shop. No complicated math.....no exotic equipment required.....no large cash outlay. Lots of work to be sure, and some of it can be downright tedious, but the reward will be a practical small scale machine shop that you might never give yourself permission to buy, assuming you could afford it. And there is also the pride in knowing you&#39;ve done it all yourself.</p><p></p><h2>Seaside Letters</h2><p>When Nantucket native Tucker McCabe hires the waitress who serves him coffee every morning, Sabrina Kincaid, to help locate his online friend Sweetpea, a mysterious woman he is falling in love with, Sabrina is not inclined to help, but she must do so to prevent Tucker from finding out that the person he is trying to find is her.

This encouraging, empowering "user's manual" for the soul teaches you how to chart a unique and personal path through the diverse landscapes of the American spiritual quest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In 1977, Lesser cofounded the Omega Institute, now America's largest adult-education center focusing on wellness and spirituality. Working with many of the eminent thinkers and practitioners of our times in the fields of religion, psychology, mysticism, science, and healing, Lesser found that the hunger for a spiritual life can be satisfied by a rich blend of the world's wisdom traditions. In <b>The New American Spirituality</b> she synthesizes the lessons she has learned from different belief systems, and intertwines them with illuminating stories from her life as a seeker, teacher, daughter, wife, and mother. She answers pertinent questions--how do you determine what is right for you from the many strains of the modern spiritual search? how do you assess a teacher or practice? how can you gauge your progress?--while warning of the tendency to miss out on real growth by merely dabbling in the latest fads. Recounting her own trials and errors and offering meditative exercises as well as references to some of the world's great spiritual teachers, Lesser provides directions through the four landscapes of the spiritual journey:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the mind: developing awareness, learning meditation, easing stress and anxiety<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the heart: finding what one really loves, dealing with grief and loss, becoming fully alive<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the body: returning the body to the spiritual fold, healing, coping with aging and the fear of death<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;the soul: naming God for ourselves, exploring other realms of consciousness, trusting the mysterious nature of the universe, developing compassion and forgiveness<br><br>Warm, accessible, and wise, The New American Spirituality is a cross-disciplinary sourcebook for the millions of Americans who, whether or not they participate in an organized religion, wish to incorporate a more meaningful, joyful, and individualized spirituality into their daily lives.</p><p>Elizabeth Lesser, cofounder of the Omega Institute, speaks to America's cross-pollination of religious, psychological, metaphysical, and ancient traditions that have flowered into contemporary spirituality. Like many seekers, Lesser has discovered a deeply personal religious path--one that wandered through Zen Buddhist monasteries, meandered through Christian churches, dabbled in African and Native American traditions, and expanded into the teachings of the Great Mother. Using her own journey as the road map, Lesser discusses why so many Americans are coming to a deeply personal form of religion--one that does not prescribe to a specific doctrine or definition of God.<p> Although she expertly performs the role of memoirist and observer, Lesser has stretched this book into a useful tool for all seekers. She offers numerous suggestions, such as how to listen to your body, increase your spiritual bank account, "live the questions" rather than "seek the answers," and create a supportive community. This is a moving workbook for anyone who's hoping to find, claim, or simply maintain their spiritual truths. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Shares guidelines &amp; practices to help listeners make choices amid the many spiritual paths open to them today.

With his thuggish manservant Jock, Mortdecai endures all manner of nastiness involving secret police, angry foreign governments, stolen paintings, and dead clients, all just to make a dishonest living&#x2015;while decked out in the most stylish garb and drinking the most bizarre alcoholic cocktails.

Drawing inspiration from the shells on the shore, Lindbergh&#39;s musings on the shape of a woman&#39;s life bring new understanding to both men and women at any stage of life. A mother of five, an acclaimed writer and a pioneering aviator, Lindbergh casts an unsentimental eye on the trappings of modernity that threaten to overwhelm us: the time-saving gadgets that complicate rather than simplify, the multiple commitments that take us from our families. And by recording her thoughts during a brief escape from everyday demands, she helps readers find a space for contemplation and creativity within their own lives. With great wisdom and insight Lindbergh describes the shifting shapes of relationships and marriage, presenting a vision of life as it is lived in an enduring and evolving partnership. A groundbreaking, best-selling work when it was originally published in 1955, Gift from the Sea continues to be discovered by new generations of readers. With a new introduction by Lindbergh&#39;s daughter Reeve, this fiftieth-anniversary edition will give those who are revisiting the book and those who are coming upon it for the first time fresh insight into the life of this remarkable woman. The sea and the beach are elements that have been woven throughout Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#39;s life. She spent her childhood summers with her family on a Maine island. After her marriage to Charles Lindbergh in 1929, she accompanied him on his survey flights around the North Atlantic to launch the first transoceanic airlines. The Lindberghs eventually established a permanent home on the Connecticut coast, where they lived quietly, wrote books and raised their family.</p><p>I found a 1955 printing of this book in an old waterfront cabin and was struck by the care with which the previous owner had read it. Eve (the name inscribed inside the front cover and then again above the heading for chapter 3) made pencil marks on nearly every paragraph of the book, underlining a phrase, highlighting many passages with strong vertical marks, scratching out some words that she seems to have found superfluous and even x-ing out whole sections that apparently missed their mark with her altogether. Two rusting paper clips isolate several pages, absent any marking at all. Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#39;s lyrical words are still relevant and presage so many of the themes of today&#39;s most popular books: simplicity, peaceful solitude, caring for the soul, a woman finding her place in society and life. I heard that the woman who had lived in the cabin had actually passed away some time before.

His previous books, <i>It's Raining Frogs and Fishes</i> and <i>A Place on the Water</i>, have received wide acclaim and have been translated into four languages. He lives with his wife and two sons in a century-old farmhouse near the shore of Lake Michigan.Dennis, a frequent contributor to <i>Smithsonian</i> and <i>Wildlife Conservation</i>, lives near Lake Michigan and has always been curious about bodies of water. He shares his fascination while discussing why water changes color, how dowsing locates subterranean springs, what causes ocean currents, how a lake freezes, and why rivers meander. Contrary to what seems most logical, rivers meander because flowing water seeks consistency and tries to deepen shallows, fill in deep spots, and smooth out rapids and waterfalls. Dennis also describes the organisms that live in water: algae and bacteria that give color to the hot springs in Yellowstone National Park; North American dippers and torrent ducks of the Andes that thrive in rushing white water; pupfishes that can survive in hot water up to 113 degrees; and flamingos whose specialized beaks are adept at filtering algae and diatoms from the saline and soda lakes in which they feed. This delightful book about watery places and the life therein contains 79 line drawings by Glenn Wolff, who has collaborated with Dennis on other projects. <i>Jennifer Henderson</i></p><h2>The Nkjv Daily Bible: Read the Entire Bible in One Year</h2><p><p>One of the most popular versions of the Bible, the NKJV, is now available in a one-year format with the release of <i>The NKJV Daily Bible</i>.

He opened his eyes, reached out with his hand, clutching. A hand caught his own, held it.</p><p>A man's hand. It was General Plodorodnuy. His most trusted lieutenant. His dearest friend. His inmost heart.</p><p>"You were dreaming, Moozh." It was the nickname that only Plod dared to use to his face.</p><p>"Yes, I was." Vozmuzhalnoy--Moozh--shuddered at the memory. "Such a dream."</p><p>"Was it portentous?"</p><p>"Horrifying, anyway."</p><p>"Tell me. I have a way with dreams."</p><p>"Yes, I know, like you have a way with women. When you're through with them, they say whatever you want them to say!"</p><p>Plod laughed, but then he waited. Moozh did not know why he was reluctant to tell <i>this</i> dream to Plod. He had told him so many others. "All right, then, here is my dream. I saw a man standing in a clearing, and all around him, terrible flying creatures--not birds, they had fur, but much larger than bats--they kept circling, swooping down, touching him. He stood there and did nothing. And when at last they all had touched him, they flew away, except one, who perched on his shoulder."</p><p>"Ah," said Plod.</p><p>"I'm not finished. Immediately there came giant rats, swarming out of burrows in the Earth. At least a meter long--half as tall as the man. And again, they kept coming until all of them had touched him--"</p><p>"With what? Their teeth? Their paws?"</p><p>"And their noses. <i>Touched</i> him, that's all I knew. Don't distract me."</p><p>"Forgive me."</p><p>"When they'd all touched him, they went away."</p><p>"Except one."</p><p>"Yes. It clung to his leg. You see the pattern."</p><p>"What came next?"</p><p>Moozh shuddered. It had been the most terrible thing of all, and yet now as the words came to his lips, he couldn't understand why. "People."</p><p>"People? Coming to touch him?"</p><p>"To . . . to kiss him. His hands, his feet. To <i>worship</i> him. Thousands of them. Only they didn't kiss just the man. They kissed the--flying thing, too. And the giant rat clinging to his leg. Kissed them all."</p><p>"Ah," said Plod. He looked worried.</p><p>"So? What is it? What does it portend?"</p><p>"Obviously the man you saw is the Imperator."</p><p>Sometimes Plod's interpretations sounded like truth, but this time Moozh's heart rebelled at the idea of linking the Imperator with the man in the dream. "Why is that obvious? He looked nothing like the Imperator."</p><p>"Because all of nature and humankind worshipped him, of course."</p><p>Moozh shrugged. This was not one of Plod's most subtle interpretations. And he had never heard of animals loving the Imperator, who fancied himself a great hunter. Of course, he only hunted in one of his parks, where all the animals had been tamed to lose their fear of men, and all the predators trained to act ferocious but never strike. The Imperator got to act his part in a great show of the contest between man and beast, but he was never in danger as the animal innocently exposed itself to his quick dart, his straight javelin, his merciless blade. If this was worship, if this was nature, then yes, one could say that all of nature and humankind worshipped the Imperator. . . .</p><p>Plod, of course, knew nothing of Moozh's thoughts in this vein; if one was so unfortunate as to have caustic thoughts about the Imperator, one took care not to burden one's friends with the knowledge of them.</p><p>So Plod continued in his interpretation of Moozh's dream. "What does it portend, this worship of the Imperator? Nothing in itself. But the fact that it <i>revolted</i> you, the fact that you recoiled in horror--"</p><p>"They were kissing a rat, Plod! They were kissing that disgusting flying creature . . ."</p><p>But Plod said nothing as his voice trailed off. Said nothing, and watched him.</p><p>"I am <i>not</i> horrified at the thought of people worshipping the Imperator. I have knelt at the Invisible Throne myself, and felt the awe of his presence. It wasn't horrible, it was . . . ennobling."</p><p>"So you say," said Plod. "But dreams don't lie. Perhaps you need to purge yourself of some evil in your heart."</p><p>"Look, <i>you're</i> the one who said my dream was about the Imperator. Why couldn't the man have been--I don't know--the ruler of Basilica."</p><p>"Because the miserable city of Basilica is ruled by women."</p><p>"Not Basilica, then. Still, I think the dream was about. . ."</p><p>"About what?"</p><p>"How should <i>I</i> know? I <i>will</i> purge myself, just in case you're right. I'm not an interpreter of dreams." That would mean wasting several hours today at the tent of the intercessor. It was so tedious, but it was also politically necessary to spend a certain amount of time there every month, or reports of one's impiety soon made their way back to Gollod, where the Imperator decided from time to time who was worthy of command and who was worthy of debasement or death. Moozh was about due for a visit to the intercessor's tabernacle anyway, but he hated it the way a boy hates a bath. "Leave me alone, Plod. You've made me very unhappy."</p><p>Plod knelt before him and held Moozh's right hand between his own. "Ah, forgive me."</p><p>Moozh forgave him at once, of course, because they were friends. Later that morning he went out and killed the headmen of a dozen Khlami villages. All the villagers immediately swore their eternal love and devotion to the Imperator, and when General Vozmuzhalnoy Vozmozhno went that evening to purge himself in the holy tabernacle, the intercessor forgave him right readily, for he had much increased the honor and majesty of the Imperator that day.</p><p>IN BASILICA, AND NOT IN A DREAM</p><p>They came to hear Kokor sing, came from all over the city of Basilica, and she loved to see how their faces brightened when--finally--she came out onto the stage and the musicians began gently plucking their strings or letting breath pass through their instruments in the soft undercurrent of sound that was always her accompaniment. Kokor will sing to us at last, their faces said. She liked that expression on their faces better than any other she ever saw, better even than the look of a man being overwhelmed with lust in the last moments before satisfaction. For she well knew that a man cared little who gave him the pleasures of love, while the audience cared very much that it was Kokor who stood before them on the stage and opened her mouth in the high, soaring notes of her unbelievably sweet lyric voice that floated over the music like petals on a stream.</p><p>Or at least that was how she wanted it to be. How she imagined it to be, until she actually walked onstage and saw them looking at her. The audience tonight was mostly men. Men with their eyes going up and down her body. I should refuse to sing in the comedies, she told herself again. I should insist on being taken as seriously as they take my beloved sister Sevet with her mannishly low, froggishly mannered voice. Oh, they look at <i>her</i> with faces of aesthetic ecstasy. Audiences of men and women together. <i>They</i> don't look <i>her</i> body up and down to see how it moves under the fabric. Of course, that could be partly because her body is so overfleshed that it isn't really a pleasure to watch, it moves so much like gravel under her costume, poor thing. Of <i>course</i> they close their eyes and listen to her voice--it's so much better than <i>watching</i> her.</p><p>What a lie. What a liar I am, even when I'm talking only to myself!</p><p>I mustn't be so impatient. It's only a matter of time. Sevet is older--I'm still barely eighteen. <i>She</i> had to do the comedies, too, for a time, till she was known.</p><p>Kokor remembered her sister talking in those early days--more than two years ago, when Sevet was almost seventeen--about constantly having to dampen the ardor of her admirers, who had a penchant for entering her dressing room quite primed for immediate love, until she had to hire a bodyguard to discourage the more passionate ones. "It's all about sex," said Sevet then. "The songs, the shows, they're all about sex, and that's all the audience dreams of. Just be careful you don't make them dream too well--or too specifically!"</p><p>Good advice? Hardly. The more they dream of you, the greater the cash value of your name on the handbills advertising the play. Until finally, if you're lucky, if you're <i>good</i> enough, the handbill doesn't have to say the name of a show at all. Only <i>your</i> name, and the place, and the day, and the time . . . and when you show up they're all there, hundreds of them, and when the music starts they don't look at you like the last hope of a starving man, they look at you like the highest dream of an elevated soul.</p><p>Kokor strode to her place on the stage--and there <i>was</i> applause when she entered. She turned to the audience and let out a thrilling high note.</p><p>"What was that?" demanded Gulya, the actor who played the old lecher. "Are you screaming already? I haven't even touched you yet."</p><p>The audience laughed--but not enough. This play was in trouble. This play had had its weaknesses from the start, she well knew, but with a mere smattering of laughter like that, it was doomed. So in a few more days she'd have to start rehearsing all over again. Another show. Another set of stupid lyrics and stupid melodies to memorize.</p><p><i>Sevet</i> got to decide her own songs. Songwriters came to her and begged her to sing what they had composed. <i>Sevet</i> didn't have to misuse her voice just to make people laugh.</p><p>"I wasn't screaming," Kokor sang.</p><p>"You're screaming now," sang Gulya as he sidled close and started to fondle her. His gravelly bass was always good for a laugh when he used it like that, and the audience was with him. Maybe they could pull this show out of the mud after all.</p><p>"But now you're <i>touching me!"</i> And her voice rose to its highest pitch and hung there in the air--</p><p>Like a bird, like a bird soaring, if only they were listening for beauty.</p><p>Gulya made a terrible face and withdrew his han...</p></p><h2>Outdoor Places</h2><p>Striking color photographs document private gardens, balconies, rooftops, patios, and terraces that offer privacy and the enjoyment of nature</p><p></p><h2>The Joys Of Jewish Cooking</h2><p>1988 Weathervane HB, ninth printing {i}.

Inside were images of our extended family on my mother&#x2019;s side, stretching back to the time I was about four years old. My mother sat close to me, leaning in to offer captions as I turned the pages. I was laughing at the way I could chart the march of adolescence by my increasingly less amused facial expressions. As my cheeks began to grow more slender, the open smile transformed, offering up a paltry, tight-lipped semblance instead.</p><p>Toward the end of the album was an image that startled me: my mother and I sitting around a large table at a restaurant, most of her side of the family arranged in seats, beaming at the camera. My face, the only brown one at the table, stands out for another reason: I&#x2019;m not even attempting a smile. In fact, I look furious. I noticed that my mother, who had been eagerly narrating the who, what, and where of each image, had gone silent. When I turned to look at her, she said simply, &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I asked. My mother looked uncomfortable. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if you don&#x2019;t remember, maybe it&#x2019;s better that way.&#x201d; This, of course, only piqued my curiosity. &#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; I said. My mother sighed. The dinner was to celebrate her parents&#x2019; wedding anniversary; my uncle had just finished going around the table with his video camera in hand, naming everyone at the table. Except he had skipped over us.</p><p>Here was a historical moment I had forgotten until it resurfaced.</p><p>Uncle Bill didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;believe in mixed marriage.&#x201d; Growing up, if I ever found myself in the same room or around the same dinner table as him, I could rely on one thing: He would not acknowledge my existence. He did not look at me and he did not speak to me. My general response was to simply ignore Bill the way he ignored me, though it would take me years before I could articulate how there was a power differential at play: He ignored me because my existence challenged his sensibilities. I ignored him because his sensibilities challenged my existence.</p><p>In retrospect, I&#x2019;m grateful for the experience of growing up around my uncle Bill. Encountering racism and its tolerance in my own family gave me a model for what it means to grow up in America.</p><p>Of course, I did not have this outlook when I was a child. The situation felt like a private matter. I didn&#x2019;t tell my friends about the uncle who did not speak to me. I did not ask my mother questions about what it meant. Before I found my way to placing this experience in a broader framework of the institutional racism at the heart of this country&#x2019;s founding, it was a personal, even shameful, story to hold. I didn&#x2019;t want to look at it any more closely because I feared that if I scratched the surface, what I would come away with were concrete reasons why I was less worthy of acknowledgment, of acceptance&#x2014;even of existence&#x2014;in this country.</p><br>&#x2014;<p><b>THESE QUESTIONS OF WHO</b> <i>belongs</i> and who doesn&#x2019;t, who is a person worth counting and who isn&#x2019;t, have always preoccupied us in America. There&#x2019;s the early stuff of our country&#x2019;s founding&#x2014;the &#x201c;handful&#x201d; of &#x201c;uncivilized&#x201d; and &#x201c;intractable&#x201d; natives who populated the country before Europeans landed on its shores, offering the gifts of these preposterously off-base adjectives along with smallpox and influenza plagues. When those indigenous people died en masse from those plagues, as well as deliberate slaughter, the African slave trade filled the gap&#x2014;men, women, and children shackled and shipped over to the New World to provide a new form of free labor to sustain the country&#x2019;s economy. Then there were the waves of willing immigrants who arrived seeking a better life. With so many cultures and languages colliding on America&#x2019;s shores, there has always been tension, and the attendant question of whether being American means to scrub yourself of your particularities, or to celebrate them.</p><p>We learn about the fractioning of human beings in a section of our high school history textbooks: each slave counting as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of getting slave owners more representation in Congress. We&#x2019;re encouraged to read these historical narratives as static, safely ensconced in the container of the past, where they ostensibly remain without leaking. We&#x2019;re encouraged to think of <i>ourselves</i> as outside of that history, too&#x2014;here to study it rather than participate in the making of it. The narrative, say, of our country overturning Jim Crow, comes to us framed in a tone of inevitability. <i>Of course</i> we had to do away with these unfair laws, the logic of these few glossy pages in our history books implies, <i>it was just a matter of time.</i></p><p>There&#x2019;s something tricky in the definition of &#x201c;history&#x201d; as we commonly use it&#x2014;the study of past events. Viewed in this way, history ruptures continuity, severing itself from the present and future. Maybe there is a kind of American-hued wish at the heart of this understanding of history&#x2014;to not be lashed to the past, to invent ourselves anew. But, of course, this severance is impossible.</p><p>The word &#x201c;history&#x201d; comes from the Greek <i>historia,</i> meaning &#x201c;knowledge acquired by investigation.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s more promise in this etymology&#x2014;room for engagement and continuity. We are accustomed to thinking of the future as containing unknowns. But the past, too, is full of hidden and lesser-known narratives. What might these narratives tell us about who we are and what&#x2019;s possible?</p><p>How does it change our understanding of the United States, for instance, to acknowledge that contemporary estimates of indigenous peoples in the Americas put the population at roughly 50&#x2013;100 million people in the late 1400s before they were decimated by European diseases&#x2014;ten times that of earlier estimates?2 Or that many of these indigenous civilizations were far more advanced in agriculture, architecture, and mathematics than the early British and Spanish empires?3 How does it change our understanding of our country to learn that the US Constitution was modeled on the Iroquois Confederacy? Or that, by 1860, the United States counted 4 million slaves among its population, valued at a worth of $3.5 billion&#x2014;making them, as historian David Blight points out, the largest financial asset in the US economy, worth more than all railroads and manufacturing <i>combined</i>?4</p><p>What do these narratives tell us about whose country this is?</p><br>&#x2014;<p><b><i>WE ARE MANY. WE ARE ONE.</i></b> The copper two-cent coin was first issued in 1864, and it was conspicuously missing the usual motto: <i>E pluribus unum</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;out of many, one.&#x201d; The Civil War was in its third year, and it seemed impossible to agree on who were the many, and who were the one. Fast forward to 1938, when the House Un-American Activities Committee was created to investigate whether any Americans had communist ties, which, according to the committee&#x2019;s calculus, would make them un-American. Fast forward even further to 2008, when, just days before the presidential election, Minnesota Republican representative Michele Bachmann accused Barack Obama and other congressional Democrats of harboring &#x201c;anti-American views,&#x201d; and suggested that the media investigate possible &#x201c;un-American&#x201d; activities.5</p><p>During the 2008 campaign, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin referred repeatedly to &#x201c;real America,&#x201d; which was apparently located only in small, rural areas of the country. Shows like <i>Saturday Night Live, The Colbert Report,</i> and <i>The Daily Show</i> all parodied the rise of public figures like Palin and Bachmann. We laughed along with a fringe-wigged Tina Fey as she repeated lines from Palin&#x2019;s media appearances almost verbatim, raising the question of what purpose satire serves in our contemporary political era. What we understood was that when Tina Fey repeated what Palin said, Fey didn&#x2019;t mean what she was saying. This restored a sense of sanity to those of us who could not, or did not want to believe that people like Palin and Bachmann could represent America. We laughed along knowingly, cynically, but above all, dismissively. These people were ridiculous&#x2014;what was happening in the country was ridiculous&#x2014;and we sought solace by feeling somehow separate from and unsullied by it all.</p><p>Thankfully, we were granted a reprieve. This appeal to the narrative of division&#x2014;separating the &#x201c;real&#x201d; from the &#x201c;fake,&#x201d; the &#x201c;American&#x201d; from the &#x201c;un-American&#x201d; didn&#x2019;t take. Barack Obama won the election in a landslide victory, insisting on an America of inclusion. As cynical and detached as many of us had grown after eight years of the Bush administration and the launch of a seemingly endless global &#x201c;war on terror,&#x201d; Obama appealed to us on remarkably earnest grounds with rallying cries of &#x201c;Yes we can&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hope&#x201d; throughout his campaign.</p><p>At his victory rally, facing a throng of hundreds of thousands of supporters at Grant Park in Chicago, Obama reiterated his message of inclusion, noting that his election was &#x201c;the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America.&#x201d;6</p><p>What to make of a man whose Americanness had been called into question now suddenly holding the highest office of the land? In his concession speech, John McCain told his supporters: &#x201c;America today is a world away from the cruel and frightful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African American to the presidency of the United States.&#x201d;</p><p>Only this widely circulated quote comes from a high-gloss transcript, doing away with the intriguing trips and stumbles found in public speeches. What McCain actually said was: &#x201c;There is no better evidence of this than the election of an Ameri...an African American to the presidency.&#x201d; For a moment, these two terms, &#x201c;American&#x201d; and &#x201c;African American,&#x201d; charged with static, vied for prominence.7</p><br>&#x2014;<p><i>What might have happened if McCain and Palin had won the election</i>? It was a question I did not think about. Democracy had proven itself. America had proven itself. I suddenly, proudly, stood behind both of those tricky and malleable terms as though they had finally delivered on their promises. I, like the other 69.5 million Americans who had voted for Obama (the highest number of votes ever won by a president,8 43 percent of which came from white voters),9 was in shock that the election had so swiftly been won. And by a <i>black man</i> no less.</p><p>I was living in San Francisco at the time, working as a journalist. I had hunkered down in a friend&#x2019;s apartment to watch the returns roll in. We were prepared for a long night, so when Obama was declared the winner at 8 p.m., we didn&#x2019;t know quite what to do with ourselves. We heard cheering nearby and walked outside the apartment building to see a few other folks doing the same. We all looked up Valencia Street, where the ruckus was coming from, and went toward it.</p><p>I have yet to experience another spontaneous public celebration like the one that occurred on the evening of November 4, 2008, in San Francisco. Thousands of people gathered in the streets, popping champagne and malt liquor bottles, passing them to strangers and friends alike. A man shimmied to the top of a traffic light while police looked on, unamused yet untroubled. People came pouring out of cars onto side streets, where they had pulled over once they realized they couldn&#x2019;t go any farther. They, too, seemed untroubled as members of the crowd continued to pass bottles and kiss cheeks with the relish of elderly aunts. I drank deep&#x2014;of the moment and of the booze.</p><p>After years of covering the George W. Bush administration as a journalist, I was exhausted. Every day had felt like a game of catch-up to whatever the latest administration run-around was&#x2014;watching a slow and steady erosion of civil liberties in the wake of 9/11, the mire of the Iraq War and the administration&#x2019;s lies that led us into it, the burgeoning &#x201c;war on terror&#x201d; that followed. It was a full-time job simply keeping up with whatever new gap in reality&#x2014;between what the administration was purporting and what reporters were unearthing&#x2014;emerged on any given day.</p><p>Throughout the Bush administration, I watched as White House spokespeople denied facts published on the front pages of every major paper. It felt like a clear refusal to acknowledge reality&#x2014;a strategy I was deeply troubled to see confirmed when journalist Ron Suskind published a story citing what a Bush aide (later revealed to be Karl Rove) had told him in 2004:</p><p>[W]hen we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#x2019;re studying that reality&#x2014;judicially as you will&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study, too, and that&#x2019;s how things will sort out. We&#x2019;re history&#x2019;s actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.10</p><p>If those in power were banking on our complacency, if they were so cynically disdainful of reality itself, what hope was there for the rest of us?</p><p>I no longer believed my reporting would change anything. Instead, I merely hoped that when it was all over, it might serve as a trail of bread crumbs&#x2014;a way to find our way back to a shared reality, to the privileges and liberties we used to enjoy, the aspirational principles of equality and inclusivity our leadership used to at least pay lip service to.</p><p>Obama&#x2019;s election&#x2014;his earnest appeal to those values of equality, inclusivity, and his respect for facts and a shared reality&#x2014;was the first time I and so many others had felt genuine hope in years. It felt like a collective sigh of relief. Marching up Valencia Street that night, I was celebrating what felt like a collective moment in which we on the Left were flirting with becoming true believers of some kind, and maybe even that rare beast among those of us well acquainted with the darker side of our history&#x2014;proud Americans.</p></p><h2>Walking with Henry: Based on the Life and Works of Henry David Thoreau</h2><p>Beautiful landscapes offers a glimpse into the grandeur of nature through Thoreau&#39;s eyes, showing how one can discover in nature Truth, Beauty, and Goodness.</p><p>Award-winning illustrator and author Thomas Locker takes readers young and old on an imaginary journey into the wilderness with America&#x2019;s greatest nature writer, Henry David Thoreau.Thomas Locker has illustrated more than 30 books, many of which he has written, including Skytree, Walking with Henry, John Muir, Hudson: The Story of a River, and Rembrandt and Titus.

The activities also sharpen analyses, synthesis, and investigative skills as well as encourage creative brainstorming and flexible thinking. <br><br> Each of the ""mysteries"" is part of a longer untold story which is ""behind the scenes."" It is up to the students to deduce the rest of the story from clues derived from answers to their Yes/No questions. For example, the story behind the sentence, ""If Leo had kept his hand down he might be a free man today,"" can eventually be revealed if enough questions are asked and the answers are used to form a mental image of the event. It may take many Yes/No questions over several days to finally reveal that Leo is a not too-bright bank robber who incriminates himself at his trial by raising his hand when the prosecutor asks a witness, ""Is the person who robbed the bank present in the courtroom today?"" <br><br> <em>Red Herring Level 1</em> includes: solution tips, suggestions, answers, a sample questioning session, and thinking map (organizer) to keep track of student thinking.</p><p></p><h2>Gift and Mystery</h2><p>The Pope recounts how and why he became a priest and offers a testimony of his faith and convictions</p><p>Blessed Pope John Paul II (1920-2005), born<b> </b>Karol Jozef Wojtyla, was beatified on May 1, 2011.

The only planet that seems to be spared is Grass, so-called because that is virtually all that grows there. It was settled by families of European nobility who live on vast estancias and indulge in the ancient sport of fox hunting--although the horses, hounds and foxes aren't what they what they appear to be. Rigo and Marjorie Westriding Yrarier and family are sent to Grass as ambassadors and unofficial investigators because the ruling families--the bons--have refused to allow scientists to authenticate the planet's immunity from the plague. The egotistical Rigo sets out to prove himself to the bons while Marjorie remains wary about the relationship between the hunters and the hunted. She gains allies in her search, but invasion strikes from an unexpected quarter before the truth about an alien species comes to light.

Tour.</p><p>In Andrea Barrett's extraordinary novel of Arctic and personal exploration, maps are deceitful, ice all-powerful, and reputation more important than truth or human lives. When the <i>Narwhal</i> sets sail from Philadelphia in May 1855, its ostensible goal is to find the crew of a long-vanished expedition--or at least their relics--and be home before winter. Of course, if the men can chart new coasts and stock up on specimens en route, so much the better. And then there's the keen prospect of selling their story, fraught with danger and discovery, to a public thirsting for excitement. Zeke Voorhees, the <i>Narwhal</i>'s young commander, is so handsome that he makes women stare and men "hum with envy"--perhaps not the best qualification for his post--but he seems loved by all. Only his brother-in-law-to-be, a naturalist, quietly mistrusts him, though he's determined to stand by the youth for his sister Lavinia's sake. At 40, eternal low-profiler Erasmus Darwin Wells has one disastrous expedition behind him and is praying for another scientific chance. He is, however, familiar with the physical risks they're taking, as well as the "long stretches when nothing happened except that one's ties to home were imperceptibly dissolved and one became a stranger to one's life." <p> And what of the women left behind? Lavinia knows little of the dangers of ice (though she's well schooled in isolation) and lives only for Zeke's return. Her companion, Alexandra Copeland, is less sanguine. Even after she's been given a secret career break--ghosting for an ailing engraver--she knows how invisible she is and how threatening her family's "dense net of obligations" will always be. Though they get less page time, Barrett is in fact as concerned with these women as she is with her seafarers. Like the heroines of her National Book Award-winning <i>Ship Fever</i>, who bump up against science and history in which only men's triumphs are written, they must somehow escape social tyranny or retreat into the consolations of storytelling or silence. </p><p> There is tyranny on board the <i>Narwhal</i> as well, as Zeke alternates between good will and paranoia, his closest companion an arctic fox he has "civilized" and who sits on his shoulder "like a white epaulet." (Alas, Sabine, like many of the men, is not to survive the journey.) Encounters with the Esquimaux--who might know more about the lost expedition than they're willing to share--not having gone according to plan, Zeke determines in late August to head for Smith Sound rather than home, despite the crew's protests. By mid-September, however, the craft is ice-locked, and it's clear they'll have to "winter over." At first the men make the best of their situation, magically sculpting cottages, castles, palaces, even a whale--and offering informal seminars in butchery, Bible studies, and basic navigation. However, as the weather worsens and Zeke grows increasingly despotic, morale plummets. </p><p> Barrett excels in both physical and social description, writing with a naturalist's precision and a passionate imagination. With quick strokes (backed up by intense research), she can fill us in on some sensible but threatening Esquimaux footgear: "All five were dressed in fur jackets and breeches, with high boots made from the leg skins of white bears. The men's feet, Erasmus saw, were sheltered by the bears' feet, with claws protruding like overgrown human toenails. Walking, the men left bear prints on the snow." The author also shines in panoramic scenes--her descriptions of the Arctic can only be called magnificent--and in small, precarious, personal moments. When Erasmus eventually returns to Philadelphia, minus his toes and his future brother-in-law, a grieving Lavinia takes to her bed. Eventually, however, she relents: "Lavinia stared straight ahead. Straight at Erasmus, her right hand tucked in her lap while her left turned a silver spoon back to front, front to back, the reflections melting, re-forming, and melting again.... Lavinia said softly, 'I forgive you.' Everyone knew she was speaking to Erasmus." </p><p> <i>The Voyage of the Narwhal</i> is full of blood-freezing surprises, a score of indelible characters, and heart-stopping mysteries. As Erasmus watches Alexandra draw landscapes he has seen before but missed something in, each pencil stroke is "like a chisel held to a cleavage plane: tap, tap, and the rock split into two sharp pieces, the world cracked and spoke to him." Readers of Andrea Barrett's novel will experience this sensation again and again. Packed with harsh truths about the not-always-true art of discovery, it is also among the most emotionally wrenching, subtle works of the century. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>&#34;The Voyage of the Narwhal&#34; has been named a 1999 American Library Association Notable Fiction Book, selected for the significant contribution to the expansion of knowledge and for the pleasure provided to adult readers.</p><h2>A Call to Joy: Discipler&#39;s Guide</h2><p>Discipler&#39;s guide to encouraging the growing believer.

Set in a place beyond good and evil-literally in Hollywood, Las Vegas, and the barren wastes of the Mojave Desert, but figuratively in the landscape of an arid soul-it remains more than three decades after its original publication a profoundly disturbing novel, riveting in its exploration of a woman and a society in crisis and stunning in the still-startling intensity of its prose.</p></p><p>Joan Didion lives in New York City with her husband, author John Gregory Dunne.

Evoking the bohemian days of a young writer and single mother, Lessing speaks openly about her writing process, her friends and lovers, her involvement in the theater, and her political activities. <em>Walking in the Shade</em> is an invaluable social history as well as Doris Lessing's Sentimental Education.</p></p><p>More casually written and organized than <i>Under My Skin</i>, the second volume of Doris Lessing's autobiography boasts the same acute, brutally frank insights.

This book helps us hear which signals are talking sense, and which are simply nonsense, so that we might know today what developments-especially those seemingly random ideas at the fringe as they converge and begin to move toward the mainstream-that have long-term consequence for tomorrow.<br><br>With the methodology developed in <i>The Signals Are Talking</i>, we learn how to think like a futurist and answer vitally important questions: How will a technology-like artificial intelligence, machine learning, self-driving cars, biohacking, bots, and the Internet of Things-affect us personally? How will it impact our businesses and workplaces? How will it eventually change the way we live, work, play, and think-and how should we prepare for it now?<br><br>Most importantly, Webb persuasively shows that the future isn't something that happens to us passively. Instead, she allows us to see ahead so that we may forecast what's to come-challenging us to create our own preferred futures.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of December 2016:</strong> At this moment, it seems obvious that we could all stand to brush up on our skills as prognosticators. And not just so we can avoid being blindsided by seismic elections, but because technology promises to continue its disruptive march through our societies and economies. What will cabbies do when cars are self-driving, and what will warehouse workers do when robots can pick, pack, and ship without lunch breaks and health care benefits? Forget NAFTA; the shift is toward Silicon Valley. But where to start? <em>The Signals Are Talking: Why Today&#x2019;s Fringe Is Tomorrow&#x2019;s Mainstream</em> is a good place. Sitting somewhere between Nate Silver and <em> The Tipping Point</em>, Amy Webb's book provides a practical guide for leaders - at any level - in the age of Big Data, offering tools for picking out the &#x201c;true signal, a pattern that will coalesce into a trend with the potential to change everything&#x201d; - and land on the right side of disruption. <em>--Jon Foro, The Amazon Book Review</em>The Signals Are Talking: Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's Mainstream is my complete methodology for how to predict future trends in technology and society, as well as their impacts on how we will work/ live and govern. It also makes an argument why now, more than ever, every single one of us must use the tools of a futurist.<br><br>We've fetishized the future, but there just aren't enough people dedicated to researching the implications of our technological progress. We've allowed ourselves be handicapped by a future blindness. Without being able to see the signals for so&nbsp;long, we've developed bad habits. It's a lack of futures thinking that led to Blackberry's demise and recent announcement of yet another round of layoffs. It's why news organizations have had such a difficult time staying afloat. It's why you might be worried, right now, about the future of your organization.&nbsp;The best time to have started planning for the future was decades ago. The second best time is right now, today.</p><h2>The Masnavi I Ma&#39;navi of Rumi: Complete 6 books</h2><p>The general theme of Rumi's thought, like that of other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, is essentially that of the concept of tawhid &#x2013; union with his beloved (the primal root) from which whom he has been cut off and become aloof &#x2013; and his longing and desire to restore it The Masnavi weaves fables, scenes from everyday life, Quranic revelations and exegesis, and metaphysics into a vast and intricate tapestry. In the East, it is said of him that he was "not a prophet &#x2014; but surely, he has brought a scripture". Rumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry, and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine, and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of "whirling" dervishes developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mawlawi which his son Sultan Walad organized. Rumi encouraged sama listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, sama represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth, and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes, and nations. In other verses in the Masnavi, Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love: The lover&#x2019;s cause is separate from all other causes Love is the astrolabe of God's mysteries. Rumi was an evolutionary thinker in the sense that he believed that the spirit after devolution from the divine Ego undergoes an evolutionary process by which it comes nearer and nearer to the same divine Ego. All matter in the universe obeys this law and this movement is due to an inbuilt urge (which Rumi calls "love") to evolve and seek enjoinment with the divinity from which it has emerged. Evolution into a human being from an animal is only one stage in this process. The doctrine of the Fall of Adam is reinterpreted as the devolution of the Ego from the universal ground of divinity and is a universal, cosmic phenomenon. The French philosopher Henri Bergson's idea of life being creative and evolutionary is similar, though unlike Bergson, Rumi believes that there is a specific goal to the process: the attainment of God. For Rumi, God is the ground as well as the goal of all existence. However Rumi need not be considered a biological evolutionary creationist. In view of the fact that Rumi lived hundreds of years before Darwin, and was least interested in scientific theories, it is probable to conclude that he does not deal with biological evolution at all. Rather he is concerned with the spiritual evolution of a human being: Man not conscious of God is akin to an animal and true consciousness makes him divine. Nicholson has seen this as a Neo-Platonic doctrine: the universal soul working through the various spheres of being, a doctrine introduced into Islam by Muslim philosophers like Al Farabi and being related at the same time to Ibn Sina's idea of love as the magnetically working power by which life is driven into an upward trend.</p><p><b>About the Author:</b> <br><br>"Mawlana Jalal-ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, also known as Mawlana Jalal-ad-Din Muhammad Balhi, but known to the English-speaking world simply as Rumi, (September 30, 1207-December 17, 1273), was a 13th century Persian (Tadjik) poet, Islamic jurist, and theologian. Rumi is a descriptive name meaning "the Roman" since he lived most parts of his life in Anatolia which had been part of the Roman Empire until the Seljuq conquest two centuries earlier.<br><br>Modern scholars now believe that Rumi was probably born in 1207 CE in Wakhsh/Vakhsh (In modern day Tajikistan, then under rule of Ghurids), while traditional sources claim his father family had for several generations lived in Balkh (In modern day Afghanistan, then incorporated into the Khwarezm Empire around 1205 CE). Both these cities were at the time included in the Greater Persian cultural sphere of Khorasan, the easternmost province of historical Persia.<br><br>His birthplace and first language both indicate a Persian heritage. Due to quarrels between different dynasties in Khorasan, opposition to Khwarizmid Shahs who were considered devious by Rumi's father or fear of the impending Mongol cataclysm, Baha-e Walad (Rumi's father) decided to migrate westwards. Rumi traveled west with his father and family, first performing the Hajj and eventually settling in Konya (In modern day Turkey, then in the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum), where he lived most of his life , composed one of the crowning glories of Persian literature and profoundly affected the culture of the area. New Persian (also called Dari-Persian or Dari), a widely understood vernacular of Middle Persian, has its linguistic origin in the Fars Province of modern Iran. A Dari-Persian literary renaissance (In the 8th/9th century) started in regions of Sistan, Khorasan and Transoxiana and by the 10th/11th century, it overtook Arabic as the literary and cultural language in the Persian Islamic world.<br><br>He lived most of his life under the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, where he produced his works and died in 1273 CE in Konya. He was buried in Konya and his shrine became a place of pilgrimate. The shrine is now known as the Mevlana Museum.

The introduction sheds light on the novel&#39;s innovations and influence and provides a biographical account of the author.

The book focused world attention on Guatemala and led to her being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992. In 1999, a book by David Stoll challenged the veracity of key details in Menchu's account, generating a storm of controversy. Journalists and scholars squared off regarding whether Menchu had lied about her past and, if so, what that would mean about the larger truths revealed in her book.<p>In The Rigoberta Menchu Controversy, Arturo Arias has assembled a casebook that offers a balanced perspective on the debate. The first section of this volume collects the primary documents -- newspaper articles, interviews, and official statements -- in which the debate raged, many translated into English for the first time.

Wambaugh's work chronicles the true lives of those involved in the dirty business of law and order, and has provided the foundational language, style and conventions for the countless writers who have tried, with mixed results, to follow in his footsteps. <i>Hollywood Hills</i>, Wambaugh's newest novel, is a cogent reminder that he remains on the beat, and as effective as ever." (<b><em>Los Angeles Times</em></b> <i><b>Jonathan Shapiro</b></i>)<br><br>"What fun it is to read Joseph Wambaugh! His Hollywood Station police procedurals - peppered with the requisite gunshots and groin kicks, sleaze and sunshine - are word-drunk wonders. If James Joyce had imagined <i>Finnegans Wake</i> as a crime story (hmmm, not a bad idea since plot was never Joyce's strong suit), it might have turned out something like Wambaugh's latest suspense story, <em>Hollywood Hills....</em>this series serves up something perhaps even more welcome as the drear days of winter settle in: an absurdist take on crime, as well as plotlines and sentences that perform buoyant loop-de-loops all over the page before making flawless landings." (<b><em>Washington Post</em></b> <i><b>Maureen Corrigan</b></i>)<br><br>"No writer describes the cop world's twin masks of comedy and tragedy as well as Joseph Wambaugh.... In <i>Hollywood Hills</i>, the fourth novel in a series that portrays the LAPD cops who work out of Hollywood Station, Wambaugh again offers dark humor, social satire, and police drama. His carefully drawn characters are colorful but utterly believable. The cops aren't super cops, but fairly ordinary, vulnerable, and imperfect human beings, which adds to their appeal.... Like Wambaugh's previous novels, <i>Hollywood Hills</i> is an entertaining and starkly realistic ride-along with the LAPD."

Instead of an East&#x2013;West power struggle with the rest of the world on the sidelines, the collective dread this time is over terrorist organizations getting their hands on a nuclear weapon, then using it to effect chaos and collapse on civil society.<br><br></p> <p>Written by two of the world&#x2019;s foremost nuclear weapons experts,<i> The Nuclear Express</i> addresses how the world got to where it is today. If we are to make the right choices now, we need to understand the history of nuclear weapons and the politics that surround them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead of fertilizer, suppose that Mr. Yousef [first World Trade Center bombing] had been able to place a primitive, five-kiloton nuclear weapon in the back of his truck. Since that vehicle had a one-ton capacity and three hundred cubic feet of drayage space, the very low-tech South African nuclear device developed during the 1980s would have fit nicely. After that February 1993 fertilizer attack, the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories ran some calculations on the theoretical results of a five-kiloton explosion on the streets of lower Manhattan on February 26, 1993, given the wind and weather conditions on that day. The most frightening results of such an attack could have been:<b></b></p> <p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most buildings south of Central Park destroyed, their inhabitants dead</p> <p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of other New Yorkers, once living south of 125th Street, dying of radiation effects</p> <p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions more throughout the metropolitan area suffering acute radiation sickness</p> <p>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Hoboken set on fire</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Unless we are attentive to history, a terrorist organization will soon be able to assemble and place such an A-bomb within a truck, ship, or container and deliver the same to the heart of any number of U.S. cities. Even &#x201c;small and inefficient&#x201d; nuclear weapons could have a devastating effect on American society and its institutions.

Take turn-of-the-century America. Remember? Life was simpler. Men were men, women honored and obeyed, and you could beat the hell out of your kids. As described in Dams's novel, life 100 or so years ago in South Bend, Ind., was like being strapped into a behavioral corset that allowed little room to live and breathe. She is especially good at period detail, while her characters are very real. Immigrant families like the Johanssons worked long hours for little pay to bring their families from the old country. In this case, relatives of the man Hilda loves ask her to find Uncle Dan, the flamboyant Democratic candidate for the city council whom the police suspect of murder. Dan was last seen talking to the victim, his political rival. His blood-stained shillelagh was left next to the body. And the only eyewitness is the parish priest who swears it was Dan who did it. Hilda's wealthy employers allow her a week off with pay to find Uncle Dan. Her methods are largely guesswork, the plot thin and improbable. Dams's prose, however, moves smoothly along. This isn't a book for everyone, but if you want to know how to clean a sooty windowsill... <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>The third Hilda Johansson mystery (after the excellent <i>Death in Lacquer Red, </i>1999, and <i>Red, White, and Blue Murder</i>, 2000) is--no surprise here--a real treat for fans of historical mysteries. Set in early-1900s South Bend, Indiana, this outstanding series offers rich, detailed, thoroughly captivating mysteries that make readers feel like they've been plucked out of their own time and set down nearly a century ago. This time around, Hilda, a servant in the fabulously wealthy Studebaker household who seems to have a knack for solving crimes, looks into the murder of a local politician and the disappearance of the prime suspect. As usual, though, the mystery here is only half the fun. Dams, who also writes the popular Dorothy Martin novels, clearly knows a lot about Indiana at the turn of the last century, and--unlike many writers of historical mysteries--she's able to incorporate factual elements into her stories so seamlessly that we can't tell (and don't care) what's real and what's made up. This is the kind of book you don't just read, you step into. If you haven't met Hilda yet, don't put it off any longer. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

As a result, patients experience several different types of cardiac bypass surgery including aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair and the Ross Procedure. <p>HOWEVER... DID YOU KNOW?In a 2007 survey, the majority of former heart valve surgery patients interviewed stated that their expectations were "mismanaged - both before and after surgery." </p><p>AND... DID YOU KNOW? In that same study, most heart valve surgery patients noted that recovering from cardiac surgery was "more difficult than expected." </p><p>The Patient's Guide To Heart Valve Surgery was written by Adam Pick, a double heart valve surgery patient, to address these troubling issues and prepare both patients and their caregivers for the challenges and opportunities of valve surgery - from diagnosis through recovery. The book is intended for patients needing heart valve repair or heart valve replacement surgeries (e.g. mitral valve repair, aortic valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, pulmonary valve replacement). </p><p>Ultimately, this unique book was created to help YOU minimize the stress of heart valve surgery and enhance the patient's recovery.</p><p>As of today, The Patient's Guide To Heart Valve Surgery has been read by thousands of patients and caregivers in over 35 countries around the world.

Its art-nouveau-style spires and visionary eccentricities bestow their unique character on the skyline and make the city a point of pilgrimage for fans of Gaudï¿½'s inimitable, playful style. <i>Gaudï¿½ of Barcelona</i> presents the architect's work in Barcelona as it has never been seen before. Vibrant, specially commissioned photographs present the wonders of the Sagrada Famï¿½lia, Casa Milï¿½, and 10 other fantastic creations in Gaudï¿½'s home city in unprecedented detail.<br><br>Tiled landscape architecture in brilliant colors, organic, plantlike pinnacles and towers, undulating tiled roofs with chimneys and ventilators looming like alien creatuers atop seething buildings--these are the features that distinguish the work of Gaudï¿½ and speak of his curious relationship with his city.

His playful spires and towers, undulating tiled roofs, and writhing chimneys loom like Dr. Suess creatures atop commercial and apartment buildings alike, and his sculptures are an integral component of many of the city&#39;s parks and public spaces. As respected for his technical innovations as for his aesthetic boldness, Gaudï¿½ was able to achieve unique, organic, fluid--at times even bizarre--architectural forms that paralleled the stylistic development of art nouveau. The artist&#39;s greatest works are brought into dramatic relief against the background of the modern metropolis with 178 specially commissioned color photographs and 13 maps of Barcelona locating Gaudï¿½&#39;s works and offering explanatory descriptions of the buildings.Journalist and writer <b>Lluï¿½s Permanyer </b>was born in Barcelona in 1939, and has specialized in chronicling his native city.

Now, she is just trying to get on with her life when another seemingly mundane act--picking up some prints at a photo lab--sends her on a mission to find a ghost from her past. A figure of the same man appears in too many pictures she's taken in the last year, lurking just far enough away to make identification impossible. But, she is not the only one who wants to know who the man is, and soon finds herself in the middle of a deeper investigation and unsure who to trust.<br><br>The only thing Ridley knows for sure is that she has to get to the truth about herself and her past if she is ever going to find her way home.</p><p>Lisa Unger is an award-winning&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;and internationally bestselling author.

The pain in my side already has me limping; there's fire in my lungs. I can't hear his footfalls. But I know he's not far away. I know now that he's been right beside me all my life in one way or another. I'm the light; he's the shadow. We've coexisted without ever meeting. If I'd been a good girl, the girl I was raised to be, I never would have known him. But it's too late for regrets.<br><br>I'm on Hart Island in the Bronx, a place known as Potter's Field. It's the city cemetery for the unknown and indigent--a grim and frightening place. How we've all wound up here is a long story, but I know the story will end here--maybe just for some, maybe for all of us. A tall abandoned building that seems to sag upon itself looms ahead of me. It's a darker night than I have ever known, in more ways than one. The sliver of moon is hidden behind a thick cloud cover. It's hard to see but I watch as he disappears through a door that hangs crooked on its hinges. I follow.<br><br>"Ridley!" The call comes from behind me. But I don't answer. I just keep moving until I am standing at the entrance to the building. I hesitate there, looking at the crooked, sighing structure and wondering if it's not too late to turn around.<br><br>Then I see him, up ahead of me. I call out but he doesn't answer me, just turns and slowly starts to move away. I follow. If I valued my life and my sanity, I'd let him get away and hope he did the same for me. We could go back to the way things have been. He dwelling in a world I never even knew existed, me going about my very ordinary life, writing magazine articles, seeing movies, having drinks with friends.<br><br>Fear and rage duke it out in my chest. Hatred has a taste and a texture; it burns like bile in my throat. For a moment, I hear the voice of someone I loved: Ridley, you can release the hatred and walk away. It's nothing more than a single choice. We can both do it. We don't need all the answers to live our lives. It doesn't have to be like this. A few minutes later, he was gone.<br><br>I know now that those words were lies. Hatred doesn't release. Walking away is not one of my choices. Maybe it never was. Maybe I've been in the path of this freight train all my life, lashed to the tracks, too weak, too foolish, too stubborn to even try to save myself.<br><br>As I enter the building, I think I might hear the rumble of boat engines. I feel a distant flutter of hope and wonder if help is coming. I hear my name again and look behind me to see a man who has become my only friend moving unsteadily toward me. He is injured and I know it will take him a while to reach me. I think for a second that I should go to him, help him. But inside I hear movement and the groaning of an unstable structure. My breathing comes shallow and quick. I step deeper inside.<br><br>"Stop running, you coward!" I yell into the huge darkness. My voice resonates in the deserted space. "Let me see your face."<br><br>My voice bounces off the surfaces around me again. I don't sound scared and heartbroken, but I am. I sound strong and sure. I take the gun from the waist of my jeans. The metal is warm from my skin. In my hand, it feels solid and righteous. This is the second time in my life I've held a gun with the intent to use it. I don't like it any better than the first time, but I'm more confident now, know that I can fire if pressed.<br><br>He steps out from the shadows, seems to move silently, to glide like the ghost that he is. I take a step toward him and then stop, raise my gun. I still can't see his face. A milky light has started to shine through the gaping holes in the ceiling as the moon moves through a break in the cloud cover. Shapes emerge in the darkness. He starts moving toward me slowly. I stand my ground but the gun starts shaking in my hand.<br><br>"Ridley, don't do it. You'll never be able to live with it."<br><br>The voice comes from behind me and I spin around to see someone I didn't expect to see again.<br><br>"This is none of your business," I yell, and turn back to the man I've been chasing.<br><br>"Ridley, don't be stupid. Put that gun down." This voice behind me sounds desperate, cracks with emotion. "You know I can't let you kill him."<br><br>My heart rate responds to the fear in his voice. What am I doing? Adrenaline is making my mouth dry, the back of my neck tingle. I can't fire but I can't lower the gun, either. I have the urge to scream in my fear and anger, my frustration and confusion, but it all lodges in my throat.<br><br>When he's finally close enough to see, I gaze upon his face. And he's someone I don't recognize at all. I draw in a gasp as a wide, cruel smile spreads across his face. And then I get it. He is the man they say he is.<br><br>"Oh, God," I say, lowering my gun. "Oh, no."<br><br>2<br><br>I bet you thought you'd heard the end of me. You might have at least hoped that I'd had my fill of drama for one lifetime and that the road ahead of me would not hold any more surprises, that things would go pretty smoothly from now on. Believe me, I thought so, too. We were both wrong.<br><br>About a year ago, a series of mundane events and ordinary decisions led my life to connect with the life of a toddler by the name of Justin Wheeler. I happened to be standing across the street from him on a cool autumn morning as he wandered into the path of an oncoming van. In an unthinking moment, I leapt out into the street, grabbed him, and dove us both out of the way of the vehicle that certainly would have killed him . . . and maybe me if I'd been thirty seconds earlier or later arriving on the scene. Still, that might have been the end of it, a heroic deed remembered only by Justin Wheeler, his family, and me, except for the fact that a Post photographer standing on the corner got the whole thing on film. That photograph (a pretty amazing action shot, if I do say so myself) led to another series of events that would force me to question virtually everything about my former perfect life and ultimately cause it to unravel in the most horrible ways.<br><br>The funny thing was, even after my life had dissolved around me, even after everything I thought defined me had turned out to be a lie, I found that I was still me. I still had the strength to move forward into the unknown. And that was a pretty cool thing to learn about myself.<br><br>My life may have looked as if it had been on the business end of a wrecking ball, but Ridley Jones still emerged from the remains. And though there were times when I didn't think it was possible, my life settled back into a somewhat normal rhythm. For a while, anyway.<br><br>If you don't know what happened to me and how it all turned out, you could go back now and find out before you move ahead. I'm not saying the things that follow won't make any sense to you or that you won't get anything out of the experience of joining me on this next chapter of my vida loca. What I'm saying is that it's kind of like sleeping with someone before you know her name. But maybe you like it like that. Maybe you want to come along and figure things out as we go, like any new relationship, I guess. Either way, the choice is yours. The choice is always yours.<br><br>Well, I'll get to it, then.<br><br>I'm the last person in the world without a digital camera. I don't like them; they seem too fragile. As if getting caught in the rain or clumsily pushing the wrong button could erase some of your memories. I have a 35-millimeter Minolta that I've been using since college. I take my rolls of film and then drop them off at the same photo lab on Second Avenue I've been using for years.<br><br>I had a friend who thought that there was something inherently wrong with picture taking. Memory, he said, was magical for its subjectivity. Photographs were crude and the direct result of a desire to control, to hold on to moments that should be released like each breath that we take. Maybe he was right. We're not friends anymore and I have no pictures of him, just this memory that resurfaces every time I go to pick up photographs. And then I think about how he liked to sing and play the guitar after we made love (and how he was really terrible at it--the guitar playing, the singing, and the lovemaking, for that matter) but that the sight of Washington Square Park outside his windows always seemed so romantic that I put up with the rest for longer than I might have otherwise. My memories of him are organic and three-dimensional, pictures that exist only for me; there's something nice about that after all.<br><br>So I was thinking about this as I pushed through the door of the F-Stop to pick up some photos that were waiting for me. A desk clerk I'd never seen before looked at me with practiced indifference from beneath a chaos of dyed black hair and twin swaths of eyeliner.<br><br>"Help you?" he said sullenly, placing a paperback binding up on the surface in front of him. I saw the flash of a tongue piercing when he spoke.<br><br>"I'm picking up photographs. Last name Jones."<br><br>He gave me a kind of weird look, as if he thought it was a name I'd made up. (A note about New York City: Here, if you leave a plain or common name, people treat you with suspicion. Meanwhile, if your name would sound bizarre or made up anywhere else in the world--for example, Ruby Decal X or Geronimo--it wouldn't even raise an eyebrow in the East Village.)<br><br>The clerk disappeared behind a dividing wall and I thought I heard voices as I glanced around at some black-and-white art shots on the wall. After a short time, he returned with three fat envelopes and lay them on the desk between us. He didn't say anything as he rang up the sale. I paid him in cash, and he slid the envelopes into a plastic bag.<br><br>"Thank you," I said, taking the bag from his hand.<br><br>He sat down without another word and returned to his book. For some reason, I turned around at the door and caught him staring at me strangely just before he averted his eyes.<br><br>I paused on the street corner at Second Av...</p><h2>The Amish Millionaire Boxed Set</h2><p><b>The Amish Millionaire--A 6-Part Romance Saga Now in One Boxed Set!</b><br><br> Follow Joel Byler home to his Amish roots in the complete Amish Millionaire series from&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling authors Wanda E.

Decades before Americans became aware of the riches to be found in the knowledge of plant medicines which native shamans had passed down over thousands of years, Ms. Maxwell, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, was scouring the Amazon ram forest for clues to this ancient medical tradition.<p>Now, on the eve of the decade in which mankind will have its last chance to determine the fate of this region and its wealth of traditional knowledge, Citadel Press's Library of the Mystic Arts is proud to bring out a newly revised edition of this classic work. Long hailed as one of the major works of popular ethno-medicine, this book is both an engaging adventure story and an engrossing account of the traditions of plant medicine to be found among the tribes of Amazonia -- and its re-release could not be more timely.</p><p>Scientists now fear that one plant species per day is being made extinct by man's ravenous appetite for "progress". Of the plants which are found only in the Amazon rain forest, only a tiny percentage have been tested for their full medical possibilities. Witch-Doctor's Apprentice is an inspiring and amusing plea to modern civilization to save these plants -- and the people who know how to use them -- before they are destroyed forever.</p><p>On the occasion of this newly revised edition, Ms. Maxwell has created an appendix which catalogs all of the plants mentioned in the text, with their scientific names, the names by which they are known locally, and their medicinal uses. This edition also includes a newintroduction by the noted ethno-botanist Terence McKenna.</p><p>"A spirited and engrossing personal narrative, as much about people and places, discomforts and dangers, the beauty of the jungle and the arc-leap of wordless communication across cultural barriers, as it is about... bringing natu</p></p><p>This memoir of travels in the Amazon has an agreeable twist: Nicole Maxwell was hunting for medicinal plants with the triple goal of conserving the jungle, improving the lot of humanity and having a great deal of fun. Her tales span countries and decades, as we watch her mature from an enthusiastic if somewhat naive idealist to a true trouper. Despite setbacks and disillusionment, she never lost sight of her goal, and lived to see others pick up the task of cultivating important medicinal plants and knowledge, and further her cause of preserving the jungle through wiser use.</p><h2>Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>The NPR Listener&#39;s Encyclopedia of Classical Music</h2><p>A complete education in classical music, written with verve and wit.

Now for readers everywhere who are concerned with the ways that management practices and principles affect the performance of the organization, the individual, and society, there is <em>The Essential Drucker</em> -- an invaluable compilation of management essentials from the works of a management legend.</p><p>Containing twenty-six selections, <em>The Essential Drucker</em> covers the basic principles and concerns of management and its problems, challenges, and opportunities, giving managers, executives, and professionals the tools to perform the tasks that the economy and society of tomorrow will demand of them.</p></p><p>Ever since his first book was published some six decades ago, Peter Drucker has been essential to everyone serious about the "management of an enterprise (and) the self-management of the individual, whether executive or professional, within an enterprise and altogether in our society of managed organizations." This distinguished 30-year Claremont University professor has continuously identified critical principles in management, economics, politics, and the world in general. And he has redirected our thinking about them through more than two dozen books, including an autobiography and a couple of works of fiction. Now, with <i>The Essential Drucker</i>, he has overseen the compilation of his most important fundamentals into one indispensable book. <p> Reaching back as far as 1954 with his treatise "Management by Objectives and Self-Control" ("Each manager, from the 'big boss' down to the production foreman or the chief clerk, needs clearly spelled-out objectives" that clarify expected contributions "to the attainment of company goals in all areas of the business"), Drucker's now-established ideas take on a surprising new relevancy when remixed equally pioneering ideas from the 1960s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. Between the thoughtful "Management as Social and Liberal Art" through the provocative "From Analysis to Perception--The New Worldview" (both originally published in 1988's <i>The New Realities</i>), this book revisits some of modern management's most inspired writing and presents it in a way that should appeal to both newcomers and those needing a refresher course on Drucker's basic beliefs. --<i>Howard Rothman</i></p><p>Peter F.

However, while many songs from other parts of the world are now available in Western hymnal collections, little has been written to help church musicians and ministers understand, appreciate, and use these songs in worship. &#34;Gather into One&#34; fills this void. In this volume C. Michael Hawn explores the work of five of the most influential global church musicians found in North American hymnals: Pablo Sosa (Argentina), I-to Loh (Taiwan), David Dargie (South Africa), Patrick Matsikenyiri (Zimbabwe), and John Bell (Scotland). Hawn discusses the biographical background of each of these composers and elucidates the meaning of their music within their respective cultures.

Scott Poole traces the confluence of history, technology, and art that gave us modern horror films and literature</b><br><br> In the early twentieth century, World War I was the most devastating event humanity had yet experienced. New machines of war left tens of millions killed or wounded in the most grotesque of ways. The Great War remade the world&#x2019;s map, created new global powers, and brought forth some of the biggest problems still facing us today. But it also birthed a new art form: the horror film, made from the fears of a generation ruined by war.<br> From Nosferatu to Frankenstein&#x2019;s monster and the Wolf Man, from Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, and Albin Grau to Tod Browning and James Whale, the touchstones of horror can all trace their roots to the bloodshed of the First World War. Historian W. Scott Poole chronicles these major figures and the many movements they influenced. Wasteland reveals how bloody battlefields, the fear of the corpse, and a growing darkness made their way into the deepest corners of our psyche.<br> On the one-hundredth anniversary of the signing of the armistice that brought World War I to a close, W. Scott Poole takes us behind the front lines of battle to a no-man&#x2019;s-land where the legacy of the War to End All Wars lives on.</p><p><b>W.

Scott Poole&#x2019;s exploration of some of the Great War&#x2019;s consequences for popular art, is fully attuned to the conflict&#x2019;s devastating psychological impact . . . Highly persuasive . . . Poole&#x2019;s general conclusions about World War I&#x2019;s transformation into art, and the process of psychological displacement that accompanied it, are incontestable." &#x2015;D.J. Taylor, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br><br> "W. Scott Poole makes a compelling case that [the First World War] launched a great age of horror fiction . . . Poole has made an important contribution to cultural history. <i>Wasteland</i> reveals how horror stories can have even darker roots." &#x2013;&#x2013;Bryan Alexander, <i>Reason</i><br><br> "Tackling the indescribable horrors of wartime is a delicate but necessary task, as Poole ventures in his latest title. Beginning with the Great War, the author exhaustively discusses the influences each era&#x2019;s war had on their directors, writers, actors and audiences of the horror genre, all while giving history lessons of the war in tow." &#x2015;<i>Fangoria</i><br><br> "Poole writes with empathic insight . . . The arc of <i>Wasteland</i> spans wide across the arts . . . He writes fluidly and with sharp intent about the traumatized and boundary shattering anxieties shot through the work of the postwar surrealists, the war-inflected apocalyptic racist horror of Lovecraft, and what he sees as the shadow of war in the fiction of Kafka . . . His skilled knitting together of a broad range of genres and the spirit of unease permeating them all carries its own salient kind of moral horror." &#x2015;Chris Barsanti, <i>Rain Taxi</i> <br><br> "A sophisticated work of cultural history . . . The book's wide-ranging erudition, strong prose, and clear love and fascination with both history and horror . . . will appeal to a variety of readers." &#x2015;Jesse Kavadlo, <i>PopMatters</i> <br><br>"[A] fascinating new book about how [World War I] reshaped western culture . . . Poole is a very gifted writer." &#x2015;Gene Walz, <i>Winnipeg Free Press</i> <br><br> "Poole brings a scholar&#x2019;s eye to the horror found in literature, film and other artistic expressions ever since [World War I] . . . <i>Wasteland</i> will appeal to film and military buffs, horror fans, those interested in popular culture and those who seek a better understanding of the escalating violence of the last 100 years . . . A fascinating read." &#x2015;Bill Schwab, <i>The Missourian</i> <br><br>"<i>Wasteland</i> spans multiple nations, dozens of battles, and traces how warfare influenced artists of all crafts. Moving beyond prejudiced perceptions of high- and low-brow art, as well as the various designations used to pigeonhole artists, Poole reveals the connective tissue holding together the bones of modern monsters." &#x2015;<i>Charleston City Paper</i> <br><br> "A fascinating read." &#x2015;Vampires.com <br><br>"Thoroughly engrossing cultural study . . . Poole persuasively argues that the birth of horror as a genre is rooted in the unprecedented destruction and carnage of WWI . . . Will make it hard for readers who haven&#x2019;t considered the wartime context for horror&#x2019;s emergence to forget it." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br><br> "Poole brings a scholar's eye and a devotee's heart to a study of the literary, film, and artistic incarnations of horror from the World War I period to today." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> "Elegantly written and cogently argued, <i>Wasteland</i> convincingly demonstrates the modern horror genre's origins in the great Dance of Death that was the First World War." &#x2015;David J. Skal, author of <i>The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror</i><br><br> "W. Scott Poole combines smart readings of the horror classics with detailed knowledge of twentieth-century history, art, and literature to dig deep into the serious side of these popular entertainments. I thought I already knew the subject inside out, but <i>Wasteland</i> introduced me to fresh facts, new ideas, and surprising connections. This is cultural history of a very high order: intelligent, lively, and wonderfully readable." &#x2015;Christopher Bram, author of <i>Gods and Monsters</i><br><br> "A book I never really thought I would read, as I don't care for horror; I flew through the pages. This is one of the most intriguing histories of war and how its influence has reached into every aspect of our lives to this day. I simply could not put this book down!" &#x2015;Shannon Alden, Literati Bookstore (Ann Arbor, MI)<br><br> "This is a book that might appear to be geared toward fans of horror, but anyone interested in history or cultural studies will find Poole's thorough analysis fascinating." &#x2015;Dave Lucey, Page 158 Books (Wake Forest, NC)<br> <p><b>Praise for <i>In the Mountains of Madness</i></b></p><p>"A deep plunge into the Lovecraft-ian dark side. Poole enthusiastically explores how H.P. Lovecraft (1890-1937) influenced modern pop culture . . . Poole seamlessly weaves biography and criticism as he shows how the fodder of Lovecraft's mental state was transformed into the eerie, occult-infused stories Nail Gaiman calls 'where the darkness begins' . . . [T]horoughly enjoyable and highly readable." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p> <p>"Must reading for both loyal Lovecraft fans and biography lovers." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p> <p>"This work by Poole makes Lovecraft's story accessible to casual readers without forsaking the level of detail expected of a more scholarly work... this book entertains and surprises, as with Poole's decision to write in the first person&#x2015;he's a wry and jovial narrator. He also takes pains to explore Lovecraft's influence upon art and popular culture... This interesting biography also provides new perspectives on the author's character that will incense the keepers of Lovecraft's mythos." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p> <p>"H.P. Lovecraft is having one hell of a resurgence. Luckily, the author of the man's latest biography is the smart, shrewd, and insightful W. Scott Poole. <i>In The Mountains of Madness</i> gives a welcome accounting of Lovecraft's career but, importantly, urgently, Poole also offers a new outlook on the women in Lovecraft's life. His mother and wife, dismissed or vilified for so long, are cast as some of his most essential supporters. What a welcome new point of view this book offers about this issue and so many others. What a wonderful testament to the lasting power and influence of H.P. Lovecraft." &#x2015;Victor LaValle, author of <i>The Ballad of Black Tom</i></p> <p>"As Poe was to the 20th century, Lovecraft is to the 21st, and W. Scott Poole's book is his Horrible Holiness's Gospels, his Revelations, and his Necronomicon, all in one, like some kind of twisted trinity guiding us deep into the mountains of madness." &#x2015;Grady Hendrix, author of <i>My Best Friend's Exorcism</i></p> <p>"Poole's grasp of Lovecraft's life is wide reaching and impressive as is his understanding of Lovecraft's current place within popular culture. Readers will find it impossible to ignore Lovecraft after this." &#x2015;Carl Sederholm, author of <i>The Age of Lovecraft</i></p> <p>"A fascinating journey of H. P.

Scott Poole has written a fascinating and illuminating socio-sexual history of the last half decade of American Pop Culture....W. Scott Poole explores deftly and accurately the history and the politics of both feminism and "the outsider," the parts of America pushed to the curb but yearning for acceptance, love, and financial success, the "new and shiny" promise of the (supposed) post war era. Poole has done a great job in bringing such a variety of disparate pieces into a singular whole, and this book should be bought and read by anyone interested in the unspoken history of Hollywood, and the darker story of our culture." &#x2015;<i>The Examiner</i></p> <p>"A fascinating journey through 1950s America...this pioneering book is a tribute to the change that Vampira incited and the awakening that so many unknowingly received from her presence." &#x2015;<i>Pasatiempo</i> (Santa Fe)</p> <p>"Poole is as concerned with the larger social changes afoot in mid-century America and uses the Vampira narrative to approach the second half of the 20th century from a fresh, and new thought-provoking perspective...[<i>Vampira</i>] provides an interesting and singular window into a time in the nation's past that can hardly be over-examined, especially as so many of the battles described are still being fought and it can often seem as if some of the hard-won gains of the era are slowly being given up." &#x2015;<i>Charleston City Paper</i></p> <p>"Poole goes to great, and effective, lengths to identify the attempts at social engineering that fostered specious notions of maleness and femaleness in the name of governmental control and selling the American dream. But the most impressive thing (besides his impeccably researched historical insight) is his understanding of Nurmi and her character in that context."&#x2015;<i>Delirium Magazine</i></p> <p>"Finally, Poole lovingly gives Vampira her due." &#x2015;<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</p> <p>"Before there was Dr. Morgus, Svengoolie, and Elvira, there was the titular Vampira. This stone-cold winner belongs in every American studies collection." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</p> <p>"Scott Poole has the chops, the Hollywood savvy, and the horror genre's insider smarts to write a killer book on Vampira. I'll be first in line to grab a copy." &#x2015;Jonathan Maberry, multiple Bram Stoker Award winner and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Assassin's Code</i> and <i>Dust &amp; Decay</i></p> <p>"Horror hostess, bondage goddess, Charles Addams cartoon come to life, Vampira was every first-generation fanboy's wet dream. Scott Poole takes us on an unforgettable ride through the overlapping underworlds of B+D magazines, Hollywood noir, and early political liberation movements that inspired actress Maila Nurmi to challenge a postwar culture bent on stifling women's, choices, bodies, and desires. This book is a subversive masterpiece." &#x2015;Sheri Holman, author of <i>Witches on the Road Tonight</i> and <i>The Dress Lodger</i></p> <p>"W. Scott Poole's last book, <i>Monsters in America</i>, was a dazzling work of cultural history: smart, funny, subversive and wildly entertaining. He showed a special gift for playfully saying serious things. His new book is even more wonderful. The life of Maila Nurmi, better known as the late-night TV hostess Vampira, is a great, strange story in itself, but also allows Poole to explore our attitudes about sex, death, fear, and difference. 'The Lady of Horror' was famous in the 1950s, but she is a remarkable symbol who connects backward to Poe and forward to Goth. She is as American as the Statue of Liberty." &#x2015;Christopher Bram, author of <i>Gods and Monsters</i> and <i>Eminent Outlaws: The Gay Writers Who Changed America</i></p> <p>"Vampira is up there with Vincent Price for lovers of the macabre, an icon whose shadow and influence lingers long after death. She's not only important to modern children of the night for being the first TV horror host, but as the original 'Glamour Ghoul,' whose style has inspired generations of Goth Girls to adopt the sexy undead look as their own. But there is more to her story than her ability to look good screaming, and Scott Poole, whose writing on the dark side of popular culture has proven to be some of the smartest, sassiest commentary on American society around, is the man to tell it." &#x2015;Liisa Ladouceur, author of <i>Encyclopedia Gothica</i></p> <p>"An expert critic of pop culture, W. Scott Poole is one of the finest historians of all that is wicked, salacious, and sexy in America. By looking into the life and times of Maila Nurmi, the former stripper turned television's dark goddess of sex and death, Poole unveils a new side of midcentury America, which we too often forget the steamy, scary, and sensational." &#x2015;Edward J. Blum author of <i>The Color of Christ: The Son of God and the Saga of Race in America</i></p> <p>"Vampira represents a way to talk about fifties culture, especially about its political and moral pressures. Scott Poole has shown how brilliantly he can unearth cultural fears and desires." &#x2015;James R.

Steele<br><br>The shuttle fell through the clouds&#x2014;ï¿½clouds as dense as grey wool, separating purple sky and sun above from perpetual rain below&#x2014;ï¿½for what seemed like a very long time until the windows finally cleared and Venus&#x2019;s global ocean lay revealed: dark blue, storm-ï¿½lashed, endless.<br><br>Engines along the spacecraft&#x2019;s boatlike underbelly fired, forming a concentric circle of white-ï¿½peaked wavelets that spread outward upon the ocean surface. Gradually the shuttle made its final descent until its hull settled upon the water. As careful as the pilots were, though, the splashdown was rough. A swift, violent jolt passed through the passenger compartment, shaking everyone in their seats, causing an overhead storage compartment to snap open and spill a couple of carry-ï¿½on bags into the center aisle. Through the compartment, people cursed&#x2014;ï¿½mainly in Russian although a few American obscenities were heard as well&#x2014;ï¿½and someone in the back noisily threw up, an involuntary act that was greeted by more foul language.<br><br>Ronson wasn&#x2019;t happy about the landing either. This wasn&#x2019;t the first time he&#x2019;d traveled off-ï¿½world, but landing on Mars was mild compared to this. He couldn&#x2019;t blame the guy a few rows back for getting sick. Although the shuttle was no longer airborne, it still remained in motion, slowly bobbing up and down as it was rocked by the ocean. He&#x2019;d been warned to take Dramamine before boarding, and he was glad he&#x2019;d heeded the advice.<br><br>Clutching the armrests, Ronson gazed through the oval porthole beside his seat. Rain spattered the outer pane, but he could still see where he was. Not that there was much to look at: ocean for as far as the eye could see&#x2014;ï¿½the Venusian horizon was about three miles away, nearly the same as Earth&#x2019;s at sea level&#x2014;ï¿½beneath a slate-ï¿½colored sky bloated by clouds that had never parted and never would. The shuttle was supposed to make planetfall at Veneragrad, but the floating colony must be on the other side of the spacecraft. Unless, of course, the pilots had miscalculated the colony&#x2019;s current position and had come down&#x2014;ï¿½landed wasn&#x2019;t the proper word, was it?&#x2014;ï¿½in the wrong place.<br><br>That was a possibility. Ronson had spent the last four months in hibernation, but his waking hours aboard the Tsiolkovsky had shown him that Cosmoflot&#x2019;s reputation for ineptitude was well deserved. He&#x2019;d just begun to consider the possibility that the shuttle was lost at sea when a tugboat came into view. Smoke belching from its funnel, the rust-ï¿½flecked craft circled the shuttle until it passed out of sight once again. Several minutes went by, then there was a thump as its crew attached a towline to the shuttle&#x2019;s prow. The shuttle began to move forward again, the tug hauling it toward its final destination.<br><br>Everyone on his side of the passenger compartment peered through the windows as the shuttle pulled into Veneragrad, including the middle-ï¿½aged Russian in the aisle seat who unapologetically leaned over Ronson as he craned his head for a look at the man-ï¿½made island. Veneragrad was as utilitarian as only a Soviet-ï¿½era artifact could be: a tiered hemisphere a kilometer in diameter, a shade darker than the ocean it floated upon, the long, wooden piers jutting out from its sides giving it the appearance of an enormous, bloated water spider. Rickety-ï¿½looking platforms, also constructed of native timber, rose as irregularly spaced towers from the outside balconies; they supported the open-ï¿½top steel tanks that caught the rain and distilled it as the colony&#x2019;s drinking water. Radio masts and dish antennae jutted out at odd angles from near the top of the dome; a helicopter lifted off from a landing pad on its roof. An ugly, unwelcoming place.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks bad, yes?&#x201d; The man seated beside him stared past him. &#x201c;Better than nothing . . . it&#x2019;s dry.&#x201d;<br><br>Ronson had already learned that his traveling companion spoke English, albeit not very well. His breath reeked of the vodka he swilled from a bag-ï¿½wrapped bottle on the way down from orbit; he&#x2019;d opened it as soon as the shuttle entered the atmosphere. &#x201c;Is this where you live?&#x201d; he asked, if only for the sake of being polite. &#x201c;Is this your home, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>The other man barked sullen laughter. &#x201c;This hellhole? No! My home, St. Petersburg. Come here to make money. Sell . . . um . . . ah&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½he searched for the right word&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201c;computers, yes? Computers for office.&#x201d;<br><br>Ronson nodded. He wasn&#x2019;t much interested in making friends with the businessman, but it appeared that conversation was unavoidable. &#x201c;Whole colony, built in space above Earth, sent here by rockets,&#x201d; the businessman continued, telling Ronson something he already knew. &#x201c;Dropped from orbit by para . . . para . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parachutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parachutes, yes. Come down&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½he lifted his hands&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201c;sploosh! in water.&#x201d; He waved the bag toward the window. &#x201c;People then build onto it. Wood from floating . . . um, forests, yes? Floating forests on moss islands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I see.&#x201d; Again, the businessman wasn&#x2019;t telling him anything new.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you see.&#x201d; The Russian took another swig from his bottle, then offered it to Ronson. &#x201c;So why you come here?&#x201d;<br><br>Ronson shook his head at the bottle. There were several ways he could get out of this unwanted conversation. He opted for the easiest approach. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a detective,&#x201d; he said, and when the businessman gave an uncomprehending look, he rephrased his answer in simpler, if inaccurate, terms. &#x201c;A cop.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A cop. Yes.&#x201d; The businessman gave him the distrustful look Ronson anticipated, then withdrew the bottle and settled back into his seat.<br><br>Ronson didn&#x2019;t hear from him again for the rest of the way into port. Which suited him well. He didn&#x2019;t want to talk about why he&#x2019;d come to Venus.<br>The heat hit him as soon as he stepped through the hatch. It was like walking into a sauna; the air was hot and thick, hard to breathe, humid beyond belief. The sun was larger and warmer here than on Earth, yet little more than a bright smear in the sky that heated up the atmosphere. Ronson began to sweat even before he reached the end of the wooden gangway that led from the hatch to the pier where the shuttle had been berthed. A fine, almost misty rain was falling, and it too was warm; he didn&#x2019;t know whether to take off the denim jacket he&#x2019;d worn on the way down or keep it on. The dockworkers didn&#x2019;t seem to mind. Most of them wore only shorts, sneakers, and sometimes a rain hat, with the women wearing bikini tops or sports bras. They unloaded the bags from the cargo bay, and Ronson took a few moments to find his suitcase before walking the rest of the way down the pier to the spaceport entrance.<br><br>There were only a couple of customs officers on duty, bored-ï¿½looking Russians in short-ï¿½sleeve uniform shirts who regarded the line of passengers with bureaucratic disdain. The officer Ronson approached silently examined his passport and declaration form, gave his face a quick glance, then put his stamp on everything and shrugged him toward an adjacent arch. No one had asked him to open his bag, but he knew what was about to happen. Sure enough, bells rang from the arch as soon as he walked through it. Its weapons detector had found the gun he was carrying.<br><br>Just as well. It only meant that he&#x2019;d meet the police sooner than he had planned.<br><br>An hour of sitting alone in a detention area, another half hour of angry interrogation by a port-ï¿½authority officer whose English wasn&#x2019;t much better than the businessman&#x2019;s, then Ronson was loaded onto an electric cart and spirited to police headquarters. Along the way, he got what amounted to a nickel tour of Veneragrad. The colony seemed to consist mainly of narrow corridors with low ceilings and low-ï¿½wattage light fixtures, their grey steel walls decorated with grime, handprints, and stenciled Cyrillic signs, then the cart passed through a broad doorway and Ronson suddenly found himself in the city center: a vast atrium, its skylight ceiling a couple of hundred meters above the floor, with interior balconies overlooking a central plaza. As the cart cut across the plaza, Ronson caught glimpses of Veneragrad&#x2019;s daily life. Residents in shorts, vests, and T-ï¿½shirts resting on park benches, hanging laundry on balcony clotheslines, standing in line in front of fast-ï¿½food kiosks. A group of schoolchildren sitting cross-ï¿½legged near a fountain, listening as their young teacher delivered a lesson. Two men in a heated argument; another couple of men watching with amusement.<br><br>A statue of V. I. Lenin stood in the center of the plaza. Incongruously dressed in a frock coat and high-ï¿½collar shirt no Venusian colonist would be caught dead wearing&#x2014;ï¿½even inside the city, the air was tropically warm&#x2014;ï¿½he pointed toward some proud socialist future just ahead. But the statue was old and stained, and a broken string that might have once been a yo-ï¿½yo dangled from the tip of his finger. The Communist Party was just as dead on Venus as it was on Earth; it was just taking the locals a little longer to get rid of its relics.<br><br>The cart entered another dismal corridor, then came to a halt in front of a pair of battered doors painted with a faded red star. The port-ï¿½authority officer who&#x2019;d questioned Ronson ushered him through the crowded police station to a private office, and it was here that he met Arkandy Bulgakov.<br><br>Veneragrad&#x2019;s police chief was about Ronson&#x2019;s own age, short and broad-ï¿½chested, with the short-ï¿½banged Caesar haircut that never seems to go out of style with European men. Seated at a desk piled with paperwork, he listened patiently while the officer delivered a stiff-ï¿½toned report of the visitor&#x2019;s offense, punctuated by placing Ronson&#x2019;s Glock on the desk along with its extra clips, then Bulgakov murmured something and waved the officer out of the room. He waited until the door was shut, then he sighed and shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the same guy who e-ï¿½mailed me a while ago about the missing kid?&#x201d; His English was Russian-ï¿½accented but otherwise perfect.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Ronson motioned to an empty chair in front of the desk; Bulgakov nodded, and he sat down. &#x201c;Sorry about the gun. I was going to tell you about it when I reported in, but . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t allow private ownership of firearms. Didn&#x2019;t you know that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I figured that my license might exempt me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No exemptions here. Only police are allowed to carry lethal weapons.&#x201d; Bulgakov&#x2019;s chair squeaked as he leaned forward to pick up the Glock; he briefly weighed it in his hand before opening a drawer and dropping it in. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t fine you, but you may not carry this. I&#x2019;ll give you a receipt. You may reclaim it when you leave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right, but what am I supposed to use until then? I might need a sidearm, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To find a missing person? I doubt it.&#x201d; Catching Ronson&#x2019;s look, the chief shrugged. &#x201c;You can buy a Taser if it makes you feel better, but only if you&#x2019;re going outside the city. And if that&#x2019;s the case, then your chances of finding this fellow . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;David Henry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;. . . David Henry alive are practically zero. At any rate, he&#x2019;s not in Veneragrad, I can tell you that right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you told me five months ago,&#x201d; Ronson said, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s what I told my client, too. But the old man isn&#x2019;t satisfied. His kid was last seen here nearly a year ago, when he came to Venus on a trip his dad bought him as a college-ï¿½graduation gift.&#x201d;<br><br>Bulgakov raised a querulous eyebrow. &#x201c;His father must be rich.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The family has a few bucks, yeah, and the kid likes to travel. He&#x2019;s already been to the Moon and Mars, so I guess Venus was next on his list. Personally, if he was my boy, I would&#x2019;ve given him a watch, but . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have many tourists, but we do get some. His kind is not unfamiliar. Privileged children coming to see the wonders of Venus&#x201d;&#x2014;ï¿½a brief smirk&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201c;such as they are. They go out to the vine islands, take pictures, collect a few souvenirs. Now and then they get in trouble . . . a bar fight, dope, soliciting a prostitute . . . and they wind up here. But they eventually go home and that&#x2019;s the end of their adventure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not how it ended for him. He didn&#x2019;t come home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So it appears.&#x201d; Bulgakov turned to the antique computer on one side of his desk. He typed something on the keyboard, then swiveled the breadbox-ï¿½size CRT around so that Ronson could see the screen. &#x201c;This is him, yes?&#x201d;<br><br>Displayed on the screen was a passport photo of a young man in his early twenties: moonfaced, arrogant blue eyes, sandy hair cut close on the sides and mousse-ï¿½spiked on top. Good-ï¿½looking but spoiled. The same boy in the picture his father had given Ronson when he&#x2019;d visited the family home in Colorado Springs. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s him.&#x201d;</p><h2>Lonely Planet Provence &amp; the Cote d'Azur (Regional Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Provence &amp; the Cote d'Azur</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

A. W. Tozer said, &#x201c;There are only three directions from which danger comes to the Christian life. They are the world through which we journey, the god of this world and our own mortified flesh.&#x201d; In this never-before-published book, the renowned teacher issues a clarion call for all Christians to awaken to the times in which we live and stand boldly against spiritual and moral slumber. Tozer&#x2019;s focus is on those few believers who will heed the call to arouse themselves rise up in the face of the great temptation to malaise that is before us, believing that God always begins with one or two who hear and heed His voice, and refuse to become weary in their pursuit of Him.&nbsp;</p><p><b>A. W. TOZER </b>embarked upon a lifelong pursuit of God at the age of 17 after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio.

She lives in New York City and Connecticut.THE WAITER STOOD OVER ME, pen at the ready. "Signorina?"<br><br>For lunch I ordered sardines on toast, pickled herring, a grilled mutton chop, buttered green beans, pommes lyonnaise and lemon sherbet.<br><br>I was twelve, sitting with my family in the dining room of Lloyd Triestino's MV Victoria as we sailed through the Strait of Malacca, en route from Singapore to Genoa. Once again, we had packed up and were moving on. Those were the days of the great ocean liners, and my first meals out were not in restaurants, but on ships.<br><br>A color reproduction of an eighteenth-century Italian Romantic painting decorated the cover of the menu. It told a story. A young woman with downcast eyes hastened across a balcony in Venice, a black veil artfully draped over her hair and shoulders to reveal her pale, comely face and low decolletage. She was holding a letter behind her as if it contained some news she couldn't bear to read. The title of the picture was Vendetta, which a translator had rendered, insipidly, "Requital."<br><br>The long menu was in Italian, with an English translation on the opposite page. The words had a dramatic poetry that made my imagination soar: "jellied goose liver froth . . . Moscovite canape . . . glazed veal muscle ï¿½ la Milanese . . . savage orange duck . . . golden supreme of swallow fish in butter . . ." And darkly: "slice of liver English-style." Because the ship docked in Bombay, Karachi and Colombo, there was also Indian food, a curry of the day described only by a town or region--Goa, Madras, Delhi--served with things I'd never heard of--pappadom, chapatti, paratha, dal and biriani.<br><br>For the next three weeks, the menu changed every lunch and dinner, with a different Italian Romantic painting on its cover (always a portrait of a beautiful woman; this was an Italian ship, after all).<br><br>I ticked off the dishes I ate and pasted the menus into a blue scrapbook. I am looking at it now. It opens with a display of black-and-white postcards of the long, elegant white ship, built in 1951, so different from the bloated shape of today's cruise liners. A Lloyd Triestino paper napkin signed with the names of the seven young members of the Seasick Sea Serpents Club, founded by yours truly, shares a page with a yellow matchbook stamped in red with the steamship company's far-flung continents of call: Asia, Africa and Australia. The passenger list erroneously records the family as embarking in Karachi. A brochure of useful hints advises "easy dress" for lunch and "formal attire" for dinner. The programs for the day's activities, slipped under the cabin door each morning, are also pasted onto my book's faded, dog-eared pages, their covers printed with commedia dell'arte figures: Pierrot, Columbine, Harlequin and clowns, one of them with a red nose, holding out a tumbler of wine. There were concerts by the ship's orchestra (as many as four a day), fancy dress balls and bartender Carlo's special cocktails, such as gin with lemon and green Chartreuse. I also glued in brochures of the places we visited when the ship docked in a port of call: a "luxury" coach tour of Bombay (where I saw vultures circling funeral pyres that burned behind high walls) and a sleepy Italian fishing village called Portofino "for people seeking rest and quiet." Pink and orange tickets to horsey horsey and tombola make a collage with the ship's airmail envelopes and its itinerary, illustrated with a red pagoda. But most of the pages of my scrapbook are taken up with menus.<br><br>Potatoes pont neuf were thick french fries. "Norcia pearls," served with Strasbourg sausage, were lentils. Rollmops were fillets of marinated herring wrapped around pickles. Hoppel poppel "in saucepan on toast" was a fry-up of onions, potatoes, pork and eggs. "Crusted pie Lucullus" turned out to be a pate laced with chunks of foie gras; chicken quenelles were dumplings, flecked with black truffles; "golden reserve" pheasant in voliere [sic] arrived in a sauce made with "fine" Champagne. Chicken cream soup "Agnes Sorel" was named for the mistress of the French king Charles XII who died suddenly at the age of twenty-eight, thought to have been poisoned. A strange name for a soup.<br><br>I was allowed to order whatever I wanted as long as I had a "properly balanced meal." The food arrived under a silver dome that was whisked off by the waiter with an operatic flourish (and not without a touch of irony) to reveal my choice du jour with its two requisite vegetables: potatoes always (available in more than two dozen ways, from "Hungarian cream" to "Castle-style," roasted with rosemary), and often, curiously, stewed red cabbage. I was even permitted half a glass of wine.<br><br>"Hai una buona forchetta!" the waiter would say, setting down my lunch of chateaubriand with mashed potatoes and Parmesan cauliflower, or cannelloni with a side order of peas. "You have a good appetite." The translator of our menus would have said, "You have a good fork."<br><br>I was tall for my age and rail thin. But I ate for two.<br><br>What were those meals really like? Would they impress me now, after years of dining out in restaurants, most often as a critic?<br><br>Those three weeks on the Victoria, eating whatever exotic dish struck my fancy, left a lifelong imprint. They were the first step to loving good food. Meals were an occasion. We bathed and changed for dinner. My father wore a tropical-weight dinner jacket, my mother one of the copies of Paris fashions she'd had made by a dressmaker in Saigon.<br><br>I bounded up the stairs when the gong sounded for the first sitting, my little sister, Philippa, in hot pursuit, hoping she'd be allowed spaghetti and meatballs yet again. I wanted to try everything. I wished I could always eat like this, in the dining rooms of ocean liners, sailing between continents, with a ravenous appetite brought on by the sea air, wondering whether today I should order Stewed Veal "Stanley" or take a chance on the cold table's Blown Poularde "Rose of May."<br>MY PARENTS BELONGED TO a hierarchical and class-conscious generation. Keeping up appearances was a nerve-racking job, and nowhere was that more evident than in the British Army and the diplomatic corps.<br><br>"I feel wrong," my mother, Lyla, would often say as she stood in front of the mirror, putting on her long gloves and patting her hair in exasperation. It was a refrain I heard throughout her life. Her forehead was too high. Her curly auburn hair was too thin, her pale skin too fine and prone to wrinkles.<br><br>There was nothing wrong with her looks. My mother was a beauty. But behind the glamorous facade, she was often frightened, as if some catastrophe were about to take place and she was helpless to prevent it.<br><br>It wasn't the travel, the upheaval involved in changing countries every two years that made my mother so often feel "wrong." It was lack of money, insecurity, the rigid British class system. She was acutely aware of rank, of who was a third secretary or a counselor in the embassy, who sat "below the salt," who was placed to the left and the right of the host and hostess of a dinner party. She pronounced the word brassiere to rhyme with sassier, and flinched at the lower-middle-class words toilet, lounge (unless in a hotel or an airport) and pardon? instead of what?<br><br>She had a high upper-middle-class English voice, but her parents were Scots Irish who'd left Ulster for England in 1922 to get away from the Troubles. It was lucky that her mother had found a job as a science teacher at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset. My grandfather, an engineer, spent much of his life either working in Africa, unemployed (during the Slump) or on sick leave, so the family scraped by.<br><br>Salaries in the diplomatic corps, moreover, were based on the assumption of a supplementary private income. Wives were not allowed to work. They were supposed to support their husbands by throwing dinners and cocktail parties, attending teas and luncheons, and knowing just enough French for the refrain, "Et combien d'enfants avez-vous, madame?"<br><br>Even food was about class distinction. The table betrayed everything. "Don't hold your knife like a pencil [lower middle class]. And don't spread your bread with butter all at once [working class]. Break off a small piece at a time [upper class]."<br><br>Working classes referred to lunch as "dinner" and dinner as "tea." Middle classes put the milk in first when they made a cup of tea. Working classes not only put the milk in first, they drank their tea at odd times of day.<br><br>Even the innocent question "What's for pudding?"--the first thing you'd ask when you sat down at the table--revealed what class you came from. The upper-class word for dessert was pudding. Lower-middle classes said sweet.<br><br>My father, Philip, didn't give a damn about any of it.<br><br>My parents were students at Cambridge when they met in 1939, the year Britain declared war on Germany. My mother read science, a subject forced upon her by my grandmother. She hated it ("I'd rather have read a book"), and went to too many parties. My father, who was on full scholarship, read modern and medieval languages. They were nothing more than friends.<br>After my father got his degree in 1943, he went to Sandhurst to train as an army officer. My mother tested bombs at the Royal Air Force base in Farnborough in Hampshire. She went up in a "harrier," a propeller-driven airplane with an open cockpit, and dropped dummy bombs, noting the angle of their fall.<br><br>In Farnborough, one of the officers took her out for a drink at a local pub and regaled her with tales of his dangerous flights.

Reprint.</p><p>In a satisfying return to Norton's Time Trader world, a young man finds himself as he teaches guerrilla warfare to a feudal, nonterrestrial offshoot of humanity in order to prepare them properly for a future in which space- and time-traveling humans are battling for survival against murderous aliens. Ross Murdock, a young criminal recruited as a Time Agent for his survival skills, is sent to the Dominion of Virgin, which had abruptly turned from a populous planet to a burned cinder as a result of time-travel by the Baldies, as the aliens are known. The key development that would have saved the planet was the evolution of mental powers that were delayed because of the turmoil following a warlord's conquests 700 years previously. Murdoch, scientist Gordon Ashe and arms expert Eveleen Riordan are sent back in time to Dominion to develop a resistance movement without revealing the existence of Earth or drawing the attention of the Baldies. The authors, who collaborated on Redline the Stars and several Witch World books, have developed an attractive world and likable characters. This coming-of-age novel may be better suited for the young-adult market, however. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Norton revives her 30-year-old Time Trader series with the help of Griffin, her collaborator on Redline the Stars (1993) and various Witchworld stories. The Time Traders--who travel in time, by what amounts to magical means, but don't trade--are epitomized by brash ex-criminal Ross Murdock, whose function is to thwart the invasion of human-occupied space by the alien Baldies. Often a disaster in the present can be averted by prompt, appropriate action in the past. So Ross, with weapons expert Eveleen Riordan and archeologist-turned-medic Gordon Ashe, must travel into the past of the planet Dominion and win a war the history books say was lost, in order to prevent destruction by the Baldies in the present. The authors offer no coherent structure or rationale for dealing with time travel and its effects. The characters and plot are stereotyped (with a predictable and drippy romance thrown in); the aliens are nasty and bald. The action involves considerable galloping about on deer-back. Wretched twaddle. Far better the Time Traders had been left to molder in peace. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He was a Fellow and Tutor in English literature at Oxford University until 1954, when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. His major contributions in literary criticism, children&#39;s literature, fantasy literature, and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include, The Chronicles of Narnia, Out of the Silent Planet, The Four Loves, The Screwtape Letters, and Mere Christianity. Visit the C.S. Lewis website at www.cslewis.com.The only thing better than exploring Narnia with your children is having Michael York do it with you. With his precise, but lively, British accent, he eases listeners into the mysterious world hidden behind the wardrobe. There the suspense and tension mount as Lucy meets Tumnus and Edmund the White Witch. With flawless accuracy York seems to sense the very timbre of the White Witch's horrible voice and the anguish of the kind faun, Mr. Tumnus. York knows, as well, how excited the children are at coming upon Mr. and Mrs. Beaver at the very moment the forest has become so mysterious and they need some sensible friends to help them; later still we hear the gentle power of Aslan, as well as his fury. Michael York gives to each an unforgettable vocal characterization that will surely live in our children's memories as the Grinch or Scrooge lives in ours. P.E.F.

Nearly one in three women in the United States will experience intimate violence in her lifetime. And while intimate violence affects relationships across the sexuality and gender spectrums, the likelihood of isolation and irreparable harm, including death, is even greater within LGBTQI communities. To effectively resist violence out there--in the prison system, on militarized borders, or in other clear encounters with "the system"--we must challenge how it is reproduced right where we live. It's one thing when the perpetrator is the police, the state, or someone we don't know.

With a foreword by Lee Child.</p><p>When Ian Fleming dismissed his books in a 1956 letter to Raymond Chandler as &#x2018;straight pillow fantasies of the bang-bang, kiss-kiss variety&#x2019; he was being typically immodest. In three short years, his James Bond novels were already spearheading a boom in thriller fiction that would dominate the bestseller lists, not just in Britain, but internationally.</p><p>The decade following World War II had seen Britain lose an Empire, demoted in terms of global power and status and economically crippled by debt; yet its fictional spies, secret agents, soldiers, sailors and even (occasionally) journalists were now saving the world on a regular basis.</p><p>From Ian Fleming and Alistair MacLean in the 1950s through Desmond Bagley, Dick Francis, Len Deighton and John Le Carrï¿½ in the 1960s, to Frederick Forsyth and Jack Higgins in the 1970s.</p><p>Many have been labelled &#x2018;boys&#x2019; books&#x2019; written by men who probably never grew up but, as award-winning writer and critic Mike Ripley recounts, the thrillers of this period provided the reader with thrills, adventure and escapism, usually in exotic settings, or as today&#x2019;s leading thriller writer Lee Child puts it in his Foreword: &#x2018;the thrill of immersion in a fast and gaudy world.&#x2019;</p><p>In Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, Ripley examines the rise of the thriller from the austere 1950s through the boom time of the Swinging Sixties and early 1970s, examining some 150 British authors (plus a few notable South Africans). Drawing upon conversations with many of the authors mentioned in the book, he shows how British writers, working very much in the shadow of World War II, came to dominate the field of adventure thrillers and the two types of spy story &#x2013; spy fantasy (as epitomised by Ian Fleming&#x2019;s James Bond) and the more realistic spy fiction created by Deighton, Le Carrï¿½ and Ted Allbeury, plus the many variations (and imitators) in between.</p></p><p><p>Mike Ripley was born in 1952. As well as being a noted critic and Lecturer in Crime Writing, he is the author of the &#x2018;Angel&#x2019; series of crime novels, for which he has twice been the recipient of a Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Award. Working with the Margery Allingham Society, he completed the Albert Campion novel left unfinished, Mr Campion&#x2019;s Farewell, and has written further continuation novels in the series.</p><p>&#x2018;As gripping and well-researched as any of the thrillers he discusses, Mike Ripley's book also provides a fascinating social history of post-war Britain.

Vï¿½clav Havel knows no other way to speak, or to write. Both as a dissident and as a playwright it was his sworn purpose for many years to combat evil with nothing but truth. As president of Czechoslovakia, and now of the Czech Republic, he has clung to that habit, refusing to turn over either his conscience or his voice to political handlers and professional speechwriters. Instead he assumes the additional burden--for him, it is a distinct pleasure--of composing all of his oratory. Audiences from New York to New Delhi, Oslo to Tokyo, have been the luckier for his decision. <br><br>This volume consists of thirty-five of these essays, written between the years 1990 and 1996, that manage to be both profoundly personal and profoundly political. Havel writes of totalitarianism, its miseries and the nonetheless difficult emergence from it. <br><br>He describes how his country and the other postcommunist countries are learning democracy from scratch and are encountering obstacles from inside and out. He marvels at the single technology-driven civilization that envelops the globe, and the challenges this presents to multicultural realities. He invokes the duty of every person alive to prevent hatred and fear from derailing history ever again. He acknowledges "the advantage it is for doing a good job as president to know that I do not belong in the position and that I can at any moment, and justifiably, be removed from it."&nbsp;&nbsp;And he reminds us that--contrary to all appearances--common sense, moderation, responsibility, good taste, feeling, instinct, and conscience are not alien to politics, but are the very key to its long-term success.</p><p>This collection of 35 essays written by the Czech playwright and human rights dissident who became the president of his country in 1989, focuses on the challenges facing an East learning democracy from scratch and a West unused to the multicultural complexities this process involves. Their organizing principle is that what is necessary now in politics and statecraft is the reaffirmation of values. &#34;It will certainly not be easy,&#34; Havel writes, &#34;to awaken in people a new sense of responsibility for the world, or to convince them to conduct themselves as if they were to live on this earth forever and be answerable for its condition one day. Who knows how many cataclysms humanity may have to experience before such a sense of responsibility is generally accepted? But this does not mean that those who wish to work for it cannot begin at once.&#34; The best vehicle for pulling this off, Havel says, are &#34;those organisms that lie somewhere between nation-states and a world community.&#34; What he has in mind are &#34;regional communities&#34; like NATO, world organizations like the U.N., and another force that he thinks might be the best suited of all for this task--the mass media.Born in Czechoslovakia in 1936, Vï¿½clav Havel is a noted playwright, a founding spokesman of Charter 77, and the author of many influential essays on totalitarianism and dissent. In 1979 he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for his involvement in the Czech human-rights movement. In November 1989 he helped found the Civic Forum, his country's first legal opposition movement in forty years, and the following month he became president of Czechoslovakia. Since January 1993 he has been president of the Czech Republic.<br><br>Paul Wilson lived in Czechoslovakia from 1967 to 1977. Since his return to Canada in 1978 he has translated into English work by many Czech writers, including Josef Skvoreckï¿½y, Bohumil Hrabal, and Ivan Klï¿½ma, and has translated and edited most of Vï¿½clav Havel's prose writings to appear in English. He lives in Toronto.</p><h2>The Lost war: Letters from British officers during the American Revolution</h2><p>Book by Balderston, Marion and David Syrett</p><p></p><h2>The Oxford Illustrated History of Roman Britain (Oxford Illustrated Histories)</h2><p>In <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of Roman Britain</em>, noted classical historian Peter Salway provides a rich account of Britain's centuries under Roman rule. Britain, Salway writes, was a place of fascination for the Romans--a fascination he brings to life with hundreds of beautiful illustrations and a thorough, authoritative narrative.<br> Before and even after the first contact with the Britons, the author writes, the Romans thought of the British Isles as an exotic place at the edge of the world, across the only ocean they knew. Salway introduces us to what is known of the pre-Roman Britons, and deftly describes Julius Caesar's dramatic expeditions in 55 and 54 B.C; in the years that followed, new contacts grew between the Romans and the inhabitants of this strange island. Salway's comprehensive narrative blends together the changing politics and ways of life of the native Britons, the climactic conquest under Claudius and the subsequent, often violent consolidation, and the place of the new province in Imperial affairs. Time and time again, he notes, this distant part of the Roman Empire demanded the finest military commanders and vast expenditures for fortifications and development. He explores the process of urbanization, as British aristocrats adapted to Roman norms, and such issues as the changing religion (with the spread of first Roman cults and then Christianity). He carefully integrates the story of Roman Britain into the story of the Empire itself, showing the close attention the emperors paid to British affairs, and the interventions in imperial politics by the legions stationed there. Salway draws on the latest archeological finds, thoughtfully assessing the evidence and weaving it into his seamless narrative.<br> Of course, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of Roman Britain</em> features hundreds of outstanding photographs and diagrams--all chosen to offer fresh insight into this distant period. Archeological sites, artifacts, coins, reconstructions, present day settings, and much more appear in both black and white and full color photographs, with informative captions by the author. Highly authoritative and highly readable, this volume brings alive the classical past of a familiar part of today's world.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Peter Salway</strong> is a Professor of Ancient History at the Open University in Great Britain, and is the author of the volume on Roman Britain in the <em>Oxford History of Britain</em>.<br>'It is not a scrap overpriced by the standards of today, for Professor Peter Salway has brought crisply together the chronological story and given us a state-of-the-art picture of what is known of the economy, lifestyles, buildings and religion in Roman Britain.

In&nbsp;<i>Through the Lens,</i>&nbsp;250 spectacular images&#x2014;some famous, others rarely seen&#x2014;are gathered in one lavish volume.<br><br><i>Through the Lens</i>&nbsp;is divided into geographical regions with a special section devoted to space exploration. Each geographical section features an outstanding array of photographs that exemplifies the area&#x2019;s unique people, wildlife, archaeology, culture, architecture, and environment, accompanied by brief but informative captions. From Barry Bishop&#x2019;s heroic Mount Everest climb in the 1950s to the glorious wildlife of Asia and Africa, from ancient Maya culture to the Afghan woman found 17 years after her piercing green eyes captivated the world, these are some of the finest and most important photographs ever taken.<br><br>Featuring master photographers from the late 1800s to today, including Frans Lanting, David Doubilet, David Alan Harvey, Jodi Cobb, William Albert Allard, Nick Nichols, and Annie Griffiths Belt,&nbsp;<i>Through the Lens</i>&nbsp;is an extraordinary photographic celebration of some of the greatest the world has to offer.</p><p>Since the 10.5 million images in <i>National Geographic</i>'s possession won't fit in a book, the 250 in this moderately glossy, minimally costly collection will do nicely. <i>Through the Lens</i> is a stunning collection of photos judiciously apportioned to represent the regions of the earth, the sea, and outer space; humans and nature; and even the history of the medium--a few historic black and whites contrast dramatically with the eye-popping modern color shots that dominate the book. As ever, the esthetic key to their impact is the use of big, emotional pictures with witty little captions, and whenever possible, startling juxtapositions. A Boston matron's faux-fur coat looks just like her pet Dalmatian (the caption identifies them as "spots fans"). The world's widest street (in Buenos Aires) by night looks great next to a grassy highway overpass for grizzly bears in Alberta. The famous green-eyed Afghan refugee poses in a purple burkha with her 1985 <i>National Geographic</i> cover. A Moscow shopper tries on a snowsuit, oblivious to the huge face in the ad on the wall behind him, whose nose he obscures and smile he bisects. A fuzzy shot of a 1907 inventor testing a multiwinged "Katydid" flying machine contrasts with a crisp 1974 shot of Skylab soaring far above fluffy clouds. Often, what's striking is the juxtaposition of ideas. An Arctic wolf making an impossible leap between ice floes arcs in midair, only its reflection hitting the frigid water. A 1935 Model T "surfs" a steep dune in White Sands, New Mexico. Chorus lines of stuffed cane-toad corpses with surreally clothespinned snouts perform on a taxidermist's shelf. Newborns are lined up like bread loaves in Shanghai. A woman in a white chador sits in the Tripoli airport, the white lines of fluorescent ceiling bulbs radiating behind her head like a saint's halo. This isn't the fanciest photo book of the season, but it certainly is a good deal. <i>&#x2013;Tim Appelo</i>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC is one of the world&#x2019;s leading nonfiction publishers, proudly supporting the work of scientists, explorers, photographers, and authors, as well as publishing a diverse list of books that celebrate the world and all that is in it.

His drive to write about the emotional journey that kids must take to become adults in a challenging and complicated world is evident through his work. Says the author: "I've thought a lot about what my job is, or should be, as an author of books for young readers. I don't write to teach, preach, lecture, or criticize, but to explore. . . .

He grew up on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii. Later, he graduated from California State University and received an MFA degree from Vermont College of Norwich University. Salisbury has worked as the skipper of a glass-bottomed boat, as a deckhand on a deep-sea fishing boat, as a musician, and also as an elementary school teacher. Today, he lives with his family in Portland, Oregon, where he manages a historic office building.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Gr. 5-9. Salisbury captures the dilemma of the Japanese who lived in Hawaii during World War II through the narrator, Tomi, born in Hawaii, and his Japanese parents, who had escaped the poverty of Japan, only to find themselves enmeshed in a war they are unprepared to fight. As tensions between Japan and the U.S. mount, eighth-grader Tomi finds himself more and more the target of his classmates' and neighbors' suspicions. Well aware of the increasing tension between native islanders and Japanese immigrants, Tomi desperately tries to tone down his grandfather's displays of nationalistic and family pride, a job the boy finds distasteful (he, too, loves the stories of his ancestors), yet horrifyingly necessary. Neither his grandfather nor the rest of the family can ignore the seriousness of the situation after the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor. On a baseball field when the first planes fly over, Tomi and his best friend, Billy, climb a nearby tree to escape the strafing and to see what is happening. Salisbury spares few details--the fear, the horror, the sounds, the smells all envelop the reader as they do the characters. And so do the grief and shame. The Japanese embarrassment is palatable, and, of course, life is never the same again. Tomi's father is eventually deported to a U.S. prison camp; his mother loses her job; and his little sister is so traumatized that she refuses to leave the house. The action-packed novel focuses on the Japanese American perspective during World War II; yet, there are few real villains here. The author subtly reveals the natural suspicions of the Americans and the equally natural bewilderment of the Japanese immigrants when they suddenly become the personification of the enemy. It is a tribute to the writer's craft that, though there are no easy answers in the story, there is empathy for both cultures.

Lewis reworks the timeless myth of Cupid and Psyche into an enduring piece of contemporary fiction in this novel about the struggle between sacred and profane love. Set in the pre-Christian world of Glome on the outskirts of Greek civilization, it is a tale of two princesses: the beautiful Psyche, who is loved by the god of love himself, and Orual, Psyche&#39;s unattractive and embittered older sister who loves Psyche with a destructive possessiveness. Her frustration and jealousy over Psyche&#39;s fate sets Orual on the troubled path of self-discovery. Lewis&#39; last work of fiction, this is often considered his best by critics.</p><p>At once more human and more mythic than his Perelandra trilogy, Lewis's short novel of love, faith, and transformation (both good and ill) offers the reader much food for thought in a compact, impressively rich story.

Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter&#39;s mental illness.

He was none the less educated at the best Jesuit schools and then at University College, Dublin, and displayed considerable academic and literary ability. Although he spent most of his adult life outside Ireland, Joyce&#39;s psychological and fictional universe is firmly rooted in his native Dublin, the city which provides the settings and much of the subject matter for all his fiction. He is best known for his landmark novel Ulysses (1922) and its controversial successor Finnegans Wake (1939), as well as the short story collection Dubliners (1914) and the semi-autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). James Joyce died in Zï¿½rich, on 13 January 1941.The editors have provided a lucid introduction and a chapter-by-chapter outline which gives one at last a vague hold on what&#39;s going on, but it&#39;s not overburdened with notes, which frees one to stop worrying and just enjoy the surrealism and exuberance of Joyce&#39;s language. * Independent on Sunday * enhances the reader&#39;s textual awareness...The captivating, accessible and rich introduction by Finn Fordham enthuses first-time readers * James Joyce Broadsheet, Dirk Van Hulle *</p><h2>Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume: Cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean</h2><p>A rare and beautiful gem of a cookbook, <em>Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume </em>celebrates the succulent cuisine of the Eastern Mediterranean, a land rich in multi-cultural Ottoman tradition.

His image-rich nonlinear style was apparently little understood or appreciated in his own country and his films received poor distribution. Tarkovsky elaborates in much detail on his theory of filmmaking, including editing, music, film acting, and what he calls "rhythm," which he considers the dominant factor. The translation appears to be excellent, but the book would have benefited greatly from an introductory essay setting the director's aesthetics and career in perspective.

Rising from humble Brooklyn roots, Capone went on to become the most infamous gangster in American history. At the height of Prohibition, his multimillion-dollar Chicago bootlegging, prostitution, and gambling operation dominated the organized-crime scene. His competition with rival gangs was brutally violent, a long-running war that crested with the shocking St. Valentine&#x2019;s Day Massacre of 1929. Law enforcement and the media elite seemed powerless to stop the growth of his empire. And then the fall: a legal noose tightened by the FBI, a conviction on tax evasion, Alcatraz. After his release he returned to his family in Miami a much diminished man, living quietly until the ravages of his neurosyphilis took their final toll. But the slick mobster persona endures, immortalized in countless novels and movies.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The true flesh-and-blood man behind the legend has long remained a mystery. Unscrupulous newspaper accounts and Capone&#x2019;s own tall tales perpetuated his mystique, but through dogged research Deirdre Bair debunks the most outrageous of these myths. With the help of Capone&#x2019;s descendants, she discovers his essential humanity, uncovering a complex character that was flawed and sometimes cruel but also capable of nobility. And while revealing the private Al Capone, a genuine family man as&nbsp;remembered by those who knew him best, Bair relates how his descendants have borne his weighty legacy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rigorous and intimate, <i>Al Capone</i> provides new answers to the enduring questions about this fascinating figure, who was equal parts charismatic gangster, devoted patriarch, and calculating monster.</p><p>DEIRDRE BAIR&nbsp;received the National Book Award for <i>Samuel Beckett: A Biography</i>. Her biographies of Simone de Beauvoir and Carl Jung were finalists for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the Simone de Beauvoir biography was chosen by <i>The New York Times</i> as a Best Book of the Year. Her biography of Anaï¿½s Nin and her most recent book, <i>Saul Steinberg: A Biography,</i> were both <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books.<b>Introduction</b><br>&nbsp;<br> This is the story of a ruthless killer, a scofflaw, a keeper of brothels and bordellos, a tax cheat and perpetrator of frauds, a convicted felon, and a mindless, blubbering invalid. This is also the story of a loving son, husband, and father who described himself as a businessman whose job was to serve the people what they wanted. Al Capone was all of these.<br> &nbsp;<br> He died in 1947, and almost seven decades later it seems that anywhere one travels in the world, people still recognize his name and have something to say about who he was and what he did. Everyone has an opinion, and yet, within the deeply private world of his extended family, there is an ongoing quest to find definitive answers about its most famous member.<br> &nbsp;<br> The saying goes that family history is often a mystery and that &#x201c;all families are closed narratives, difficult to read from the outside.&#x201d; Attempting to reconstruct their truth is much like trying to solve the most complicated puzzle imaginable. In the case of those who bear a name that is famous or, as in the case of Al Capone&#x2019;s relatives and descendants, infamous, the task can be heavy indeed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of his relatives found it easier to change their surname than to deal with its history, choosing to distance themselves and deny the relationship for a variety of reasons. Some merely wanted to lead ordinary private lives. Some said they feared reprisals from gangland Chicago, while still others who remained &#x201c;connected&#x201d; in varying degrees said they wanted to make their way in that world unencumbered by Al&#x2019;s long shadow. Still, there were those who kept the Capone name but said it was the reason why they had to lead peripatetic lives, some moving as far away as they could get, while others only moved cautiously from one town to another throughout northern Illinois, never far from the security and familiar environment of Chicago.<br> &nbsp;<br> In recent years, the question of who has the right to claim a legitimate place within the family of Al Capone has resulted in some interesting pieces that may or may not fit into the puzzle of its history. &#x201c;You who only know him from newspaper stories will never realize the real man he is,&#x201d; said his sister Mafalda in 1929, when he was in his prime. It is a remark echoed in so many other instances by his granddaughters, who have only recently become involved in sorting out what they call their &#x201c;amazing family history.&#x201d; All four granddaughters (three of whom survive in 2015) called Al Capone &#x201c;Papa.&#x201d; They loved him deeply as small children and still do as adults. With children and grandchildren of their own who ask about Papa, they now call him a &#x201c;conundrum.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> One of the questions they ponder repeatedly is how one man could embody so many vastly different personality traits. They talk among themselves about their family history; they argue and debate about whose memory is the most correct and the closest to the truth. They always strive to assess their grandparents and parents with honesty, objectivity, distance, and detachment, and they admit the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of arriving at definitive conclusions.<br> &nbsp;<br> When they talk about their papa, they first put &#x201c;Al Capone&#x201d; in air quotes as they ask themselves what gave rise to the myth and legend. How did the grandfather they adored fit into all these stories? Where was the real person within the grandiose and exaggerated public personality, whose exploits continue to grow more outrageous seven decades after his death? What was it that makes the name of a man who died sick, broke, and demented in 1947 so instantly recognizable a decade and a half into a brand-new century? Are we fascinated with him today because of the so-called Roaring Twenties, the colorful time in which he lived? Is it because we now seek to understand the many ethnic histories that formed our country, and therefore the circumstances of his birth and family life as an Italian-American that might shed light on our own assimilation as Americans? Or, is it simply Al Capone&#x2019;s larger-than-life personality, the outsized figure who strutted across our historical stage for such a brief time that we did not have enough time while he was with us to assess him? After so many intervening years, can we figure him out? And after seven decades, is nothing left but the myth?<br> &nbsp;<br> The members of his family agree with me that the enigma of Al Capone is a riddle to be solved and now is the time to try to do it. I was initially contacted by several members of the immediate family and the extended clan who were undertaking their own searches into the origins of their family and its subsequent history. I have been privileged to discuss my book with those people, and I have also benefited greatly from interviews and conversations with many other members of the extended Capone family whom I met throughout my research. Here, when I speak of the extended clan, I am including those who are definitely related, those who claim to be, and those who would just like to know whether or not they are.<br> &nbsp;<br> While most prefer to keep their lives as private as possible and asked me not to reveal their true names or where they lived, they all agreed that everything they told me would be on the record. Those who asked me to keep their lives private often have children or grandchildren who don&#x2019;t mind being identified at all; they tell me it&#x2019;s &#x201c;cool&#x201d; to have a relative like Al Capone because he is far enough in their past that no onus is attached to their present circumstances. I have honored everyone&#x2019;s wishes because they all insisted that everything they told me was the truth as they knew it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mine is a curious hybrid of a book, because I concentrate more on the private man than the public figure. I admit that it is impossible to write about Al Capone without taking notice of the major events of his public life, but my aim was not to give yet another version of such well-trod ground unless I could provide new insights into it. Rather, my intention was to look at his public behavior within the context of his personal life, to see how the two might possibly be interrelated, and how the one might have had influence or bearing on the other. This was not an easy task, and like his family members I still wonder if it is possible to arrive at that curious postmodern concept of &#x201c;the real truth.&#x201d; Starting in his lifetime, so many histories, biographies, articles, and profiles were written about Al Capone that even with today&#x2019;s technology it is impossible to arrive at an accurate tally of the secondary documents. All of them purported to be the truth, and perhaps they were at the time they were written. But as we know, what is true for one generation is usually subject to new and different interpretations by the next.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whenever I speak to any member of the Capone family, our conversations always seem to end on the same note: the enigma of Al Capone is a riddle that our efforts may help to solve, and we share the consensus that our contributions to the task are beginnings but certainly not the final endings.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: The Early Years</b><br>&nbsp;<br> Gabriele Capone was twenty-nine years old when he boarded the ship <i>Werra</i> that brought him to the United States in June 1895. With him were his wife, Teresa Raiola Capone, twenty-seven, and their two sons, three-year-old Vincenzo and seventeen-month-old Raffaele. Although they traveled as most other Italian immigrants did, in second class or steerage, Gabriele was unlike the majority who had to indenture themselves to pay for passage, for he had a trade that paid his family&#x2019;s way. He was a baker who had specialized in making pasta, which earned him a decent living in his native village of Castellammare di Stabia, just outside Naples. He was confident that his skills would easily lead to employment that would let him thrive in the New World. Gabriele was unlike his countrymen in another way: although Naples and its surrounding villages provided one of the largest contingents of Italian immigrants to America, and many bore the fairly common surname of Capone, none of his closest relatives had left their village, so no one was waiting on the dock to greet him and ease his way. A third distinction from most of the nearly fifty thousand other Italians who arrived that same year was probably most significant: he could read and write and had acquired a smattering of English that, coupled with a natural linguistic ability, he used from the beginning to navigate the teeming perils of life in New York.<br> &nbsp;<br> A rumor surrounding his arrival has it that Gabriele did not enter the United States directly because he did not have enough money to pay the entrance fee imposed on immigrants at Ellis Island. Some of his descendants believe that he went instead to Canada and sneaked over the border, although they have no documentation to show how he would have found the money to go there if he did not have sufficient funds to leave Ellis Island. It is one of the earliest myths surrounding the origins of the Capone family in America; all that can be verified is that Gabriele Capone avoided New York&#x2019;s largest Italian settlement in Manhattan&#x2019;s crowded, crime-ridden Mulberry Bend on the Lower East Side and headed directly for Brooklyn. He had been forewarned of Mulberry Bend&#x2019;s dangers by the letters written by others from his village who came before him, but the tenement apartment he found in the area near the New York Naval Shipyard was not much better. Known locally as the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it was another gang-infested area of vice and crime where local thugs took turns hassling and assaulting the sailors who poured out of the main gate at the end of Navy Street. It was cheaper to live there than in Manhattan, and Gabriele thought it a possibly better place for a pasta maker to find work as a baker. However, this was not to be, and to find a way to support his family, he re-created himself as a barber.<br> &nbsp;<br> His initial plan was to find work in someone else&#x2019;s shop until he could save enough money to set up one of his own, but he could find no one to hire him, so he had to take whatever work was offered. There is no mystery about why he abandoned baking, for it would have cost money he did&nbsp;not have to set up a shop of his own, which was the same reason he did not initially become a barber with his own shop. Other Italians who could not&nbsp;afford to set up a shop usually practiced their trades in their homes and made enough money to scrimp by, which Gabriele could have done as well. However, he was a cautious man, which was probably why he chose instead to find steady work alongside 90&nbsp;percent of the city&#x2019;s Italian population, doing day labor whenever he could find it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Much of it was the &#x201c;dirty work&#x201d; done under the auspices of the city&#x2019;s Public Works Department, the hard and dangerous physical labor building subways, sewers, and skyscrapers that no other ethnic group was desperate enough to take. Italians had replaced the Irish at the bottom of the ethnic influx by the 1890s, when an official in city government described the situation succinctly: &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t get along without the Italians; we want someone to do the dirty work and the Irish aren&#x2019;t doing it any longer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gabriele fared better than most when he was hired as a grocery store clerk because the job enabled him to read, write, and speak English a little better every day. It was different for Teresa, who was already pregnant with her third child before the boat landed and who gave birth in 1895 to another son, Salvatore, in the Navy Street tenement. From the time they arrived, she helped her husband save money for a barbershop by taking in piecework for various garment factories. Because she worked at home and because everyone in her small enclosed world only spoke Italian, she had little reason to improve her English and throughout her life spoke it hesitantly. She was like most other Italian-American women of her generation, who all used the expression of going &#x201c;down to America&#x201d; when they had to venture beyond their known worlds of local tenements and shops; Teresa was representative of all their hesitations and fears because she insisted that her only safety came from within the sanctity of the family, which she always gathered close about her.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether by accident or design, there were no more children until 1899, when Gabriele was finally able to set up his own shop in a slightly better neighborhood at No. 69 on Brooklyn&#x2019;s elegantly named Park Avenue, a street whose quality of life was far removed from its Manhattan counterpart. He moved his growing family into an apartment above the shop where they were living when their first child conceived in the New World, Alphonse, was born on January 17, 1899. Teresa had hoped this pregnancy would result in a girl who would mark the end of her childbearing years, but neither was to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alphonse was followed by five more children, the sons Erminio (1901), Umberto (1906), and Amadoe (1908) and the daughters Erminia (born and died 1910) and Mafalda (1912). At home, each child was called by the formal Italian baptismal name, but on the streets and at school the boys quickly adopted American versions. Vincenzo called himself Jimmy, and the others became (in the order of their birth) Ralph, Frank, Al, John (or sometimes Mimi), Albert, and Matthew (or Matty). Mafalda, who bore the pretentious name of King Victor Emmanuel&#x2019;s coddled princess daughter, never had a childhood nickname, for she liked the status her name gave and would not have tolerated one. Only as an adult were some of her favored nieces and nephews permitted to call her Aunt Maffie, and if she was in one of her bad moods, she might not respond until they used her full name.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brooklyn&#x2019;s Park Avenue, unlike Manhattan&#x2019;s WASP enclave, was a curious mix of ethnic identities. Al came of age in the decade between 1910 and 1920, when the metropolitan area swelled with an immigrant influx that amounted to&#x2014;according to the lawyer and patron of the arts John Quinn&#x2014;&#x201c;seven or eight hundred thousand dagos, a couple of hundred thousand Slovaks, fifty or sixty thousand Croats and seven or eight hundred thousand sweating pissing Germans.&#x201d; To Quinn, they were &#x201c;nothing but walking appetites,&#x201d; and as he thought of so many other earlier arrivals, he despised them as well.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Capones lived among them, on the fringe of the Italian section where it gave way to a mix of Irish, German, and eastern Europeans. Unlike other Italian ghettos in the New York area, where buildings were occupied by compatriots from the same province, sometimes segregated by floor based on families who came from the same tiniest villages, the Italian residents of this particular part of Brooklyn came from a variety of Italian homelands and spoke different dialects. Here, only the Sicilians kept to themselves in buildings of their own, but on the streets Al&#x2019;s playmates and school classmates traced their origins throughout the poorest parts of southern Italy, from Sicily to Campania and Calabria. They all spoke &#x201c;broken&#x201d; English as he did, a mix of the dialects they heard at home and the heavily accented English that was pounded into them at school.

They focus on: the holy presence, the mystery of God, recognizing God in all things, listening for God&#39;s call, the prayer of silence, and contemplative reading of scripture.

The Nez Perce, or Nimiipuu, inhabited much of what is now north central Idaho and portions of Oregon and Washington for thousands of years. The story of how western settlement drastically affected the Nimiipuu is one of the great and at times tragic sagas of American history. &nbsp;Renowned western historian Alvin M. Josephy Jr. describes the Nimiipuu&#x2019;s attachment to the land and their way of life, religion, and vibrant culture. He also chronicles the western expansion that displaced them, beginning with the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1805 and followed by the influx of traders and trappers, then miners and farmers. Josephy traces the ill fortune of the Nez Perce as their homeland was carved up by treaties, creating an atmosphere of hostility that would culminate in the Nez Perce war of 1877 and conclude with Chief Joseph&#x2019;s famous pronouncement: &#x201c;I will fight no more forever.&#x201d;&nbsp;Despite the challenges of the past, the Nimiipuu have maintained their ties to the land. In his introduction to the book, Jeremy FiveCrows details how the tribe has fought for self government to undo the damage wrought by shortsighted practices.</p><p>Alvin M. Josephy Jr. (1915&#x2013;2005) was a leading historian of the American West and author of many award-winning books, including <i>Red Power: The American Indians&#x2019; Fight for Freedom</i>, available in a Bison Books edition. Jeremy FiveCrows is a member of the Nez Perce Tribe and serves as the tribal liaison and publications editor at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. Prior to working for the commission he was the editor of the Nez Perce tribal newspaper, the <i>Tats Titoqan.</i>&#x201c;FiveCrows&#x2019; insight into the &#x2018;still-vibrant heritage&#x2019; of the tribe is a valuable addition to Josephy&#x2019;s traditional historical commentary.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (Deborah Donovan <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Particularly poignant are the accounts of how tribal leaders were divided during treaty negotiations. . . .

Some reviewers call <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> the best reference work on animals ever published. Others call it the legacy left to us by famed zoologist and animal lover, Bernhard Grzimek. The accolades and praise go on for the newest addition to Gales line of reference titles. The original 13-vol. set, published in Germany in the late 1960s, is internationally renowned for its scientific reporting, coverage and illustrations, and serves as a major point of reference for researchers and students studying the animal kingdom. Thorough articles familiarize readers with animals found everywhere on the globe, detailing their life cycles, predators, food systems, overall ecology and much more. Staying true to the original scientific pedigree, Gale enlisted prominent advisors and contributors from the international scientific community to incorporate recent developments in the animal world. Our new editions of <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> are sure to serve the needs of students at every academic level.</p></p><p>The final volumes of the massive revised <i>Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia</i> have finally rolled off the press. We reviewed volumes 8 to 11 (<i>Birds</i>) in the January 1 &amp; 15, 2003, issue, and volumes 4 and 5 (<i>fishes</i>), volume 6 (<i>amphibians</i>), and volume 7 (<i>reptiles</i>) in the December 1, 2003, issue. Volume 17 is a comprehensive index. <p>H. C. Bernhard Grzimek hoped his original encyclopedia would "disseminate knowledge of the animals and love for them." This is also a goal of the revised edition; it does not disappoint. All volumes follow a similar organization. Introductory chapters, written in a narrative style, are usually followed by taxonomic chapters and species accounts, which follow a prescribed format. There are no page references from the main account of the species to the illustrations; the index at the end of each volume must be consulted. Color photographs, illustrations, and distribution maps supplement the text. Additional resources include references to books, periodical articles, organizations, and Web sites.</p><p>Volume 1, <i>Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes</i> (e.g., sea anemones, sponges, jellyfish, flukes, tapeworms, nematodes), and volume 2, <i>Protostomes</i> (e.g., mollusks, gastropods, annelids), represent animals often not well known to nonspecialists. The authors do an excellent job of presenting current research and scientific facts in combination with interesting sidelights. Volume 3, <i>Insects</i>, is written in an engaging style and provides a good overview of more than 1.5 million known species. Volumes 12-16, <i>Mammals</i>, are a rich source of information on this popular group, from platypuses to moles to bats to wildebeests to whales to humans. The illustrations are of mixed appeal; some look like strained imitations of reality, while others seem as if the animals could walk off the page.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote to him: "I am very happy in reading [<i>Leaves of Grass</i>], as great power makes us happy ... I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be."</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Cannabis Revealed: How the world&#39;s most misunderstood plant is healing everything from chronic pain to epilepsy</h2><p><p>Did you know you have a widespread receptor system that interacts with the compounds in cannabis? <em>Cannabis Revealed</em> is the only book written by a medical cannabis specialist, explaining the science behind the use of this amazingly therapeutic plant and describing in easy-to-understand detail the recently discovered endocannabinoid system, involved in almost every human physiologic process.

Alexander has received a Newbery Medal, a Newbery Honor Award, a National Book Award, and several IRA-CBC Children&#x2019;s Choice Awards. He is also the author of many ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Books and School Library Journal Best Books of the Year.<br><br><b>Trina Schart Hyman</b> was a children's book illustrator for more than 30 years. Hyman graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1960.&nbsp;She won the 1985 Caldecott Medal for her work on Margaret Hodges' book <i>Saint George and the Dragon. </i>Hyman was one of the first white illustrators along with Ezra Jack Keats to regularly incorporate black characters into her illustrations. She spent the last 10 years of her life with her romantic partner, Jean K. Aull, and passed away in 2004.Grade 1-4-- A young carpenter, tired of hammering and sawing, seeks out a fortune-teller to see what his future holds. The cagey old prophet promises him a rosy future--well, maybe. `` `Rich you will surely be,' '' says the fortune-teller, if `` `you earn large sums of money.' '' Moreover, `` `You shall wed your true love . . . if you find her and she agrees. And you shall be happy as any in the world if you can avoid being miserable.' '' Pleased with these promising, if ambiguous, predictions, the carpenter leaves, only to get halfway home and decide he has more questions to ask. But the fortune-teller has mysteriously vanished, leaving the carpenter in the quirky hand of fate where, in typical Alexander fashion, his life takes a surprising and humorous turn. The story's warm and witty tone is reinforced by Hyman's masterful illustrations. Expressive figures are dynamically placed against a West African landscape, in colors so rich and clear that they invite readers to touch the fabrics and breathe the air. Visual details--carved wooden stools, traditional cloth patterns, signs in French--add an authenticity to the story (which is actually set in Cameroon), while touches of humor in postures and expressions underscore Alexander's gentle wit. These illustrations are obviously a labor of love. Vibrant with life and good humor, this is a supremely satisfying creation. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bury Her Deep (A Dandy Gilver Mystery, 3)</h2><p><p>Dear Alec, <br>Remember my engagement yesterday? The annual duty luncheon for the Reverend Mr Tait from which and whom I expected only boredom? I could hardly have been more wrong, Alec dear, and I am this minute packing to follow the Reverend home to his manse in Fife, there to attend a meeting of the Rural Womens' Institute. Hardly a house party at which one would usually leap, I grant you, but not only is the man himself a perfect darling - imagine Father Christmas shaved clean and draped in tweed - but his parish, it seems, heaves with more violent passions than a Buenos Aires bordello. A stranger, you see, is roaming the night and pouncing on the ladies of the Rural. At least that's the tale they're telling and the one that Mr Tait told me, but since half the village think he's a figment and he only ever strikes at the full moon, I cannot help but wonder if there's something even odder going on . . . </p><p>Much love and remember me fondly if the dark stranger gets me, <br>Dandy xx</p><p><b>Catriona McPherson's latest novel in the series, <i>Dandy Gilver and a Spot of Toil and Trouble</i> is now available for pre-order.</b></p></p><p>Catriona McPherson was born in the village of Queensferry in south-east Scotland in 1965 and educated at Edinburgh University. She left with a PhD in Linguistics and spent a few years as a university lecturer before beginning to write fiction.

Catriona now writes full-time and lives on a farm in Galloway.'Barbara Pym meets Dan Brown . . . The strengths of BURY HER DEEP all derive from the voice of the narrator.

She is gauche but perceptive, married but unromantic (although there's a lovely frisson to her co-solver), sly but endearingly innocent. The period detail is accomplished and convincing, the crime is neatly convoluted and McPherson's prose bristles with clever asides under a lucid surface. I wouldn't be surprised if she is translated on to the small screen soon, and I can't wait for her next adventure.&#x2015;<b><i><i>Scotland on Sunday</i> on AFTER THE ARMISTICE BALL</i></b><br><br>McPherson is an exemplary crime writer, effortlessly balancing the driest wit with melodramatic suspense. Her range of reference is seriously literary, her research impeccable, and her exuberance with period detail utterly beguiling.

I giggled endlessly, loving Dandy's occasionlly caustic, often cowardly and eternally optimistic sleuthing.

The answer lies in the quality of its strategy-making process, contends leading strategic management scholar Robert A. Burgelman in this extraordinary book based on an exhaustive twelve-year study he conducted inside Intel Corporation. <br> Granted the opportunity to track Intel's strategy-making through his close teaching collaboration with its chairman, Andy Grove, at Stanford Business School since 1988, Burgelman has written a definitive and far-reaching account of how highly educated top managers groped their way through strategic conundrums. His account of the evolution of key events in Intel's history is illustrated with extensive quotes from its cofounder Gordon Moore, Andy Grove, current CEO Craig Barrett, and dozens of other Intel executives. His study allows these leaders to speak for themselves in scores of highly rendered executive portraits. <br> Using thoroughly tested conceptual tools, Burgelman first documents the key role played by mid-level managers in transforming Intel from a memory company into a microprocessor company during the late 1970s and early 1980s, which led to the heartbreaking decision to abandon the business on which the company had been founded in 1968. He then makes readers eyewitnesses to the complex set of complementary strategic thrusts orchestrated by Andy Grove to make Intel capi- talize on the extraordinary opportunities associated with the phenomenal growth of the PC industry during the late 1980s and the 1990s. He reconstructs Grove's resolution of the struggle between two competing micro- processor architectures within Intel that caused civil war to erupt, and he shows how Intel's superbly run strategy-making process in the core business, paradoxically, made it difficult for internal entrepreneurs to extend the company's strategic reach. This allows him to link the strategic leadership challenges, faced today by Craig Barrett, to Intel's illustrious past and to provide suggestions for how these challenges can be met. <br> At once a history of strategy-making at Intel as well as a strategy-making field manual that any high-technology manager will need to consult frequently, <i>Strategy Is Destiny</i> truly describes strategy-in-action as the way of life of senior executives in the corporation of the future.</p><p>Robert A.

C. Beck, Renï¿½ Goscinny, Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Kirby, Moebius, Art Spiegelman, and Gahan Wilson. What started out as a special insert for <i>Rolling Stone </i>took on a life&#x2014;and mythology&#x2014;of its own as writer/editor Michel Choquette traveled the world, commissioning this visual chronicle of the 1960s, only to find himself without a publishing partner or the financial support to continue. Forty years later, readers finally get to experience this legendary anthology as Choquette celebrates the birth, death, and resurrection of <i>The Someday Funnies&#x2014;</i>129 previously unpublished strips by 169 writers and artists.<br><br>Praise for <i>The Someday Funnies:<br></i><br>&#x201c;In 1970, National Lampoon contributor Choquette was asked by Jann Wenner to edit a special comics insert for Rolling Stone that would allow prominent cartoonists and writers to survey the 1960s. That collection, &#x201c;The Someday Funnies,&#x201d; transformed over the next few years into a never-published book featuring the work of 169 writers and artists, and then&#x2014;when Wenner pulled the plug&#x2014;into the great lost project of comics history, a &#x201c;Pet Sounds&#x201d; of mainstream, underground, and European sensibilities existing only in Choquette&#x2019;s Montreal storage space. Thirty-one years later, it&#x2019;s finally seeing print and it&#x2019;s a doozy, featuring work from luminaries like Art Spiegelman, Joost Swarte, Jack Kirby, and Will Eisner. There are also comics written by Harlan Ellison and William S. Burroughs, and illustrations from such unlikely suspects as Tom Wolfe and Federico Fellini. What sticks with a reader now is the way the &#x2019;60s had already begun to curdle in the memory even for those who had just lived them; more than one of these comics posits wild-eyed alternate histories of the &#x2019;60s, including the book&#x2019;s kicker, a great Captain Marvel strip that ties the decade&#x2019;s woes to Billy Batson&#x2019;s mid-century silence. Though the collection is, by its nature, a mixed bag, it&#x2019;s a priceless time capsule of comics history, presented handsomely by Abrams in the large tabloid size Choquette always envisioned."<br>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</p> <p>&#x201c;[A] treasure trove of sixties cartooning finally hits print. . . .

Because Choquette recruited globally, <i>The Someday Funnies</i> avoids the usual American baby-boomer mythology, in which the sixties were born in Greenwich Village, nurtured at Berkeley, and killed at Altamont. Instead, the book reports just as much on the youth revolution in Europe, from the perspective of people who&#x2019;d just lived through it.&#x201d;<i> &#x2014;Onion&#x2019;s A.V.

The 23 known artists represented include N. C. Wyeth, Howard Pyle, and Walter Crane. The work of several unknown illustrators of everything from the Bayeux Tapestry, a medieval psalter, and an 18th-century chapbook to comic books, a card game, and shoe advertisements is also included. Accompanied by Vivian's 1906 version of the text, this collection of vintage art is an attractive reminder of the importance of the Robin Hood legend in Western culture. Seeing several artists' interpretations of the same well-known scene, such as Robin Hood and Little John's first encounter at the bridge or the tournament where Robin Hood wins the silver arrow, adds a fascinating dimension to the history of the legend. The absence of captions to identify the illustrations is disappointing. Although information on the art and dates are provided in a section of acknowledgments at the end of the book, the arrangement by artist's name (including 13 entries for "unknown illustrator") rather than by page number makes the task of locating data about a particular image cumbersome and time-consuming.

Here he came across the ruins of a community and isolated homesteads. These homes, he realized, gave clues as to the characters and lives of the thousands of landless people who, seduced by the advertising of the railroad companies in the early 20th century, took the train West in search of new lives and a permanent agricultural community. What had happened to turn these homesteaders&#39; hopes of a new beginning into such despair? The land which betrayed them turned out to be an America in miniature. This is their story.</p><p>Jonathan Raban ambles and picks his way across the Montana prairie, called &#34;The Great American Desert&#34; until Congress offered 320-acre tracts of barren land to immigrants with stardust in their eyes. Raban&#39;s prose makes love to the waves of land, red dirt roads, and skeletons of homesteads that couldn&#39;t survive the Dirty Thirties. As poignant as any romance novel, there&#39;s heartbreak in the failed dreams of the homesteaders, a pang of destiny in the arbitrary way railroad towns were thrown into existence, and inspiration in the heroism of people who&#39;ve fashioned lives for themselves by cobbling together homes from the ruined houses of those who couldn&#39;t make it. Through it all, Raban&#39;s voice examines and honors the vast open expanses of land and pays homage to the histories of families who eked out an existence.What other writers are saying about <b>Bad Land</b>:<p>Paul Theroux, author of <b>My Other Life</b>, calls it a "...masterpiece in which we clearly see the vivid paradoxes of America's history and Raban on his own personal journey, as one of our wisest and most articulate travellers.</p><p>"Because Mr. Raban is both English and a marvelous observer, he sees aspects of the plains invisible to the native-born.

Roxanne was born in 1962, the daughter of Rina Swentzell, a potter, architect, writer, and scholar from Santa Clara Pueblo, and Ralph Swentzell, a New Jersey-born philosophy professor at St. John's College in Santa Fe. </p><p>For her last two years of high school Roxanne attended the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, where she was given the first exhibition of her clay figures. Later she studied at the Portland Museum Art School in Oregon. Today Roxanne's work, much of which is also produced in bronze limited editions, is collected internationally. It has earned numerous honors, including many first place and best of class awards at Santa Fe Indian Market and the Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair and Market. Her work is extensively exhibited in museums and galleries, and in 1997, <em>Emergence of the Clowns</em> was part of an exhibition of Native American sculpture at the White House.</p><p>In this generously illustrated art book, Santa Fe writer Gussie Fauntleroy explores with Roxanne the ideals and beliefs that underpin her work. Her sculptures of human figures capture beauty that is unspoiled by glamour and enhanced by dignity, self-awareness, and humor. Along with her Pueblo community, she cherishes memory--the continuum of the ancestral past with present and future--which nourishes the wisdom to look beyond contemporary pop-culture idolatry and choose a more fundamental humanity. Her figures exalt the small, ordinary, everyday choices we make that define our integrity and enable us to become extra-ordinary.</p><p>Roxanne's many admirers love her art for its simplicity, humanity, humor and superior craftsmanship. This book enables readers to enjoy Roxanne's artwork in the company of her quiet and observant spirit.</p></p><p>Gussie Fauntleroy</p><h2>The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracles</h2><p>From the Preface: Over the many years we have been teaching &#39;A Course in Miracles&#39;, it has become apparent that its radical message has often been a source of much confusion, misunderstanding, and distortion. It is our aim to help clarify Course principles -- through this question-and-answer format -- in order to facilitate greater understanding and application of its thought system. The 72 questions are arranged by topics including Jesus, the metaphysics, application, form, language, and the curriculum of &#39;A Course in Miracles.&#39;</p><p>Gloria Wapnick has a Masters degree in History from Hunter College. From 1963-65, she lived in Tehran, Iran, where she taught English to Iranian students at the Iran-American Institute, and Social Studies at the American High School. Returning to the States in 1965, she taught Social Studies in the New York City Junior High and High Schools until 1984, and was Dean of Students for the last four years. Gloria has been working with A Course in Miracles since 1977. She is Vice-President and co-founder with her husband Kenneth of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula CA. Gloria has also co-authored two books on the Course with Kenneth. Kenneth Wapnick has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and has been working with &#39;A Course in Miracles&#39; since 1973, when he joined Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. In addition, he worked closely with Helen preparing the final manuscript of the Course. Since that time he has lectured widely on &#39;A Course in Miracles.&#39; He has written more than 25 books on the Course and has also produced over 150 audio and video titles explaining and discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder with his wife Gloria of the Foundation for &#39;A Course in Miracles&#39; in Temecula CA. Together they have traveled nationally and internationally giving workshops on the Course.24) If all this is a dream or an illusion, or a script which is already written, what difference does it make what I do with my life? <p>While on one level A Course in Miracles does teach that this world is an illusion and that in truth our experiences here are hallucinations, on another level Jesus assures us that "it is almost impossible to deny its [the body's] existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy from of denial" (text, p. 20; T-2.IV.3:10-11). Since it was our wrong minds that wrote the script of our many "lifetimes" in this delusional hologram of hatred, it would follow that the ego's purpose would be to reinforce belief in the seeming reality of our experience here, which reflects our belief in the reality of our separation from God. And nothing serves this purpose better than the defense of denial, which makes the thoughts of guilt and fear so unacceptably real that they need to be repressed and never looked at again. This ensures that the thought of separation remains real within the split mind, "safe and protected" from the Holy Spirit. </p><p>A Course in Miracles presents us with a choice between two ways of living in this dream world, which is the only true choice remaining to us within the dream. As we implied earlier, the Course teaches that we have a split mind which is really tri-partite in structure: 1) a wrong mind that holds the ego thought system in place, and even though it appears that we have choices within the wrong mind, Jesus unequivocally states that to believe that there is a choice in the thought system of the ego is delusional and self-deceptive; 2) a right mind which is the home of the Holy Spirit, and holds a correction for each misthought or miscreation of the ego thought system; and 3) the part of the mind that chooses between the ego and the Holy Spirit, which we refer to as the decision maker. Therefore, our only true choice and freedom within the illusory dream of separation is to choose our right minds, allowing our wrong minds to be undone. We shall return to this important point in a later question. </p><p>Consequently, A Course in Miracles instructs us that the only purpose the world holds is for us to choose the forgiveness script. The Holy Spirit offers us a correction for the ego's nightmare dreams of guilt and attack, wherein the world becomes a classroom in which we can learn the lessons of forgiveness. In this way, the guilt we made that ultimately brought about the making of the body and the world is undone. Simply indulging the ego's fantasies under the justification that "It doesn't matter anyway" would make these desires real (otherwise why indulge them?), and root one still further in the ego's dream of guilt. Such self-indulgence could include acting out repressed desires such as murder, theft, deception, anger, sexual exploitation, etc., or on the other hand, giving way to thoughts of meaninglessness, depression, and even suicide. And thus the above question -- "What difference does it make what I do with my life?" -- can be understood from a totally different perspective. This is a perspective that gives great meaning to our lives, for it states: "I have a choice to make: which dream do I choose to follow; to which dream will I be loyal?" </p><p>In summary then, we see that on the metaphysical level, everything we do -- not to mention our personal identity -- is an illusion. However, on the level of the dream, where we most certainly believe we are, our lives make a tremendous difference; not so much in terms of what we do, but with whom we do it. Only by choosing Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our teacher, guide, and friend can we undo the cause of our remaining asleep and dreaming dreams which are rooted in the belief in the reality of the separation from our Source, and from each other. We cannot change the script, which is already written and has indeed been undone. But we can change from the ego's script to the Holy Spirit's. Helping us to accomplish this is the purpose of A Course in Miracles. 52) Is the Jesus of A Course in Miracles the same Jesus written about in the Bible, and the same person who walked the earth in Palestine two thousand years ago? </p><p>Yes, it is definitely the same Jesus who appeared in the world two thousand years ago, with the same message of truth -- in content obviously, not form. However, it is extremely hard to believe that the Jesus of A Course in Miracles is the same figure written about in the Bible, just as it would be difficult to accept that the biblical Jesus resembles the truly historical one. This is not the place to delve into issues of scripture scholarship and how the gospels were written, but suffice it to state for our purposes here that the figure found in the four gospels, as well as the teachings recorded in the other books of the New Testament, are often diametrically opposed to what we find in the Course. Rather than attempt a procrustean fit of a round peg in a square hole, it seems much safer and intellectually honest for students of A Course in Miracles to accept that the biblical Jesus represents the collective projections of the various authors of the gospels and epistles, while the voice and person of Jesus in A Course in Miracles represents the ego-free being who lived and taught two thousand years ago. In conclusion, the Jesus of the Bible and the Course are mutually exclusive figures, with only the common name linking them together. </p><p>For a more thorough discussion of these differences, the reader is referred to A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue. 67) A Course in Miracles is a universal teaching, why did it come in such sectarian (i.e., Christian) terms? Doesn't that limit its worldwide applicability? </p><p>While the basic message of A Course in Miracles is universal -- "God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation" (manual, p. 3; M-1.3:5) -- its form certainly is not, nor is it meant to be. We have already quoted Jesus' words to the effect that this is a "special curriculum," which clearly reflects that it has a special audience: the Western world that has grown up under the strong influence of Christianity and 20th-century psychology, an influence that has not been very Christian nor spiritual. This is why the Course's language is so Western, and, more specifically, Christian and psychodynamic in statement. As the specific spiritual path we call A Course in Miracles, the Course is simply not meant to have worldwide applicability. Other cultures and religious traditions have, and will continue to have their own spiritual paths, just as we in the Western world now have the Course, among many others. As we have repeatedly pointed out in this book, the universal joining with all people is the content of the universal course, but the specific ways in which people learn this lesson constitutes the forms of the "special curriculum," of which A Course in Miracles is simply one example. Forms, almost by definition, are not the same and cannot blend together. Therefore they cannot be universal, or for all people. This is why Jesus teaches in the introduction to the clarification of terms, to repeat and extend this important statement: A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed (manual, p. 73; C-in.2:5-6). This "universal experience," it goes without saying, is love, and A Course in Miracles is but one form of regaining it.</p></p><h2>Anti-Memoirs</h2><p>The dust jacket has minor closed tears to the head and the heel of the spine.</p><p>Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Global Rift: The Third World Comes of Age</h2><p>Sets forth a comprehensive study of the historical, political, social, and economic development of the Third World since the fifteenth century</p><p></p><h2>The Drawing Projects: An Exploration of the Language of Drawing</h2><p><i>Drawing Projects</i> combines a review of contemporary artists with a 'how to draw' guide, celebrating drawing as the process of seeing made visible.<br><br><i>Drawing Projects</i> profiles ten key artists, revealing their working environments and practices, including Gavin Turk, Dryden Goodwin, Keith Tyson, Cornelia Parker, William Kentridge, Claude Heath, Tim Knowles and Zoe Mendelson.

She had come to the Christmas party at church reluctantly, hoping to find some peace and joy for her soul. But in the midst of her friends&#x2019; amiable banter, all she could hear were the words of her husband, Don. They were words that had cut her to the quick: &#x201c;You are so dull and stupid. I don&#x2019;t know why I ever married you.&#x201d;<br><br>Don was on one of his tears. Just last month he seemed to be doing better, trying harder and treating his wife better, but then things began to tense up. There had been a minor disagreement over a Christmas present, and from that point on, Don had seemed to become angrier and angrier. The man who just a few days before had vowed his love for her now was cursing her and raging at her. This man she loved but feared was almost destroying her.<br><br>It was so hard to put it all together. Her pensive look would have given her away if anyone had looked at her closely.

You understand what it means to be caught in the undertow of a relationship that seems to pull you down. Each time there is a lull in the tension, you tell yourself, <i>This time, everything is going to be all right.</i> Yet in a few hours or a few days, you are thrust into confusion again. Often you are blamed for whatever negative circumstances occur, and yet for the life of you you can&#x2019;t figure out why.<br><br>Sarah is a woman who was forced to look reality square in the face. &#x201c;My mother can be so much fun and a real friend in tough situations, if she wants to be. She is generous with my kids, and we look forward to her monthly visits.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah tried to love her mother, Mary, but Mary had another side to her that baffled Sarah and everyone else. &#x201c;I guess you could say she has a major blind spot,&#x201d; Sarah explained. &#x201c;Everything will be going along fine, and then something happens to upset Mother. We never know what it will be; we just find out that she&#x2019;s upset. Her anger flares, and she has what my dad always called &#x2018;one of her three-day mad spells.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s had these so many times throughout my life that I have felt there was no hope. I&#x2019;ve figured that&#x2019;s just the way she is and I just have to live with her spells that throw us all off balance. What bothers me now, however, is that I&#x2019;ve seen her do the same thing to my children. She tells them, &#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t want to come stay with Granny, it&#x2019;s okay,&#x2019; but then she punishes them for not coming. She withdraws, and no one hears from her until she eventually calls. Then everything is fine again&#x2014; for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears as she recalled a particularly painful incident with her mother. &#x201c;My daughter had a very rare form of cancer three years ago, when she was eight. Since my mother lives only an hour from us, she volunteered to stay at the house with my son while my husband and I were at the hospital. The afternoon after Mother arrived, she called the hospital room, demanding to know where I &#x2018;hid&#x2019; the mop. She wanted to clean my &#x2018;filthy&#x2019; kitchen floor. Since we were talking to the oncologist about the treatment plan for my daughter, I told Mother I would have to call her back. She insisted that I tell her right then where I put the mop! Sensing by my end of the conversation that she was pushing me, my husband took the phone and said, &#x2018;Mary, we will call you back later. The doctor is here, and we can&#x2019;t talk.&#x2019; Then he just hung up the phone.<br><br>&#x201c;When we got home that evening, Mother wasn&#x2019;t speaking. She never asked about her granddaughter but only made an announcement: &#x2018;I am leaving.&#x2019; I was too exhausted from the whole ordeal with my daughter to argue with her, so I just went to the bedroom and closed the door. I heard Mother say one last loud sentence to my husband before the front door slammed. &#x2018;Obviously,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;my presence isn&#x2019;t needed.&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;t have the energy to stop her, and honestly, I didn&#x2019;t want to try. We had been through episodes like this before. I always found a way to smooth things over, to pack it all away and never mention it again until finally things would return to normal...if you can call that kind of relationship normal.<br><br>&#x201c;About three days later, Mother called and asked about my little girl as if she hadn&#x2019;t even been at our house. I was angry with her, but as usual, I told her what she wanted to hear, and I never brought up the incident again. There have been other incidents since then, and they&#x2019;re really starting to wear me out. My dad tried to reason with her for years about her &#x2018;mad spells,&#x2019; but he might as well have been talking to the wall. She refuses to even admit she has them much less be willing to change. She thinks she is just fine, and if people have a problem with her, well, it&#x2019;s just too bad. They are wrong, and if she&#x2019;s really mad, she calls them &#x2018;stupid&#x2019;!<br><br>&#x201c;I love my mother, and I want to be a good daughter. I don&#x2019;t want to be mean or act unchristian, but I just can&#x2019;t stand to walk on eggshells anymore. And I don&#x2019;t want my children to have to either. Something&#x2019;s got to change...but I&#x2019;m afraid it will never be Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>Sarah is describing the kind of complex, crazy-making relationship many of us experience sometime in our lives. Her mother, as generous and fun as she can sometimes be, has more than a blind spot. She has a dangerous character flaw that ensures that anyone who gets close to her will eventually be ensnared by her manipulation. Mary exhibits the behavior of one whom the Bible identifies as a <i>fool</i>.

Black soldiers believed their participation in the fight to make the world safe for democracy finally earned them rights they had been promised since the close of the Civil War.</p><p>Instead, an unprecedented wave of anti-black riots and lynchings swept the country for eight months. From April to November of 1919, the racial unrest rolled across the South into the North and the Midwest, even to the nation's capital. Millions of lives were disrupted, and hundreds of lives were lost. Blacks responded by fighting back with an intensity and determination never seen before. </p><p><i>Red Summer</i> is the first narrative history written about this epic encounter. Focusing on the worst riots and lynchings&#x2014;including those in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Charleston, Omaha and Knoxville&#x2014;Cameron McWhirter chronicles the mayhem, while also exploring the first stirrings of a civil rights movement that would transform American society forty years later.</p></p><p><p>Cameron McWhirter is a staff reporter for <i>The </i><i>Wall Street Journal</i>. He was awarded a Nieman Foundation Fellowship for Journalism at Harvard in 2007. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p>1.</p><p>Carswell Grove</p><p><i>[T]here has been nobody suffered in this matter like I have. I did not do nothing at all to cause that riot.</i></p><p>JOE RUFFIN</p><p>April 13, 1919, was perfect for a celebration. As Joe Ruffin set out to do his morning chores that Sunday, the sky was cloudless and blue. The temperature was in the high 70s&#x2014;normal for spring in east Georgia.</p><p>The sixty-year-old man started the day at his barn, rushing to feed his pigs, cows, and horses so he would not be late. He had sent his children ahead to the Carswell Grove Baptist Church in one of the family's two cars, a Buick Six. Ruffin would follow later. The church festival was to mark its fifty-second anniversary. Preachers from several counties were coming to deliver sermons. The choir would give a special performance. More than three thousand people would be on hand for a gala cookout of roast pig and fried chicken. Though Ruffin was not a Carswell Grove member, he had been asked to speak as a prominent black Mason and treasurer of another black church.</p><p>Ruffin had lived his entire life amid fields of cotton and sugar cane east of Millen, the seat of Jenkins County. The land he tilled was once part of the plantation where his parents worked as slaves. Ruffin remained on good terms with the Daniel family, the former slave owners. Ruffin owned almost 113 acres.1&nbsp;He ran five to seven plows a season&#x2014;a substantial operation for anyone in that part of Georgia at the time and a major accomplishment for a black farmer. Unlike many blacks in the area, he could read and write, though census records did not report him having any formal education.2</p><p>Many of the years had been tough. Several times Ruffin had to mortgage tracts of land. He even took out loans on his mules and horses to cover debts.3</p><p>He had a large family. The 1910 census recorded three sons and four daughters living with him, plus another son and his family down the road. Ruffin was a widower.</p><p>Two sons&#x2014;John Holiday, twenty-six, and Henry, thirteen&#x2014;lived at home. Louis Ruffin, in his late twenties, farmed nearby.4&nbsp;A fourth son, Joe Andrew Ruffin, twenty-four, served with the U.S. Army in France. He was due home in time for the fall harvest.</p><p>Whatever Ruffin's past struggles, 1919 was shaping up to be profitable. Cotton was fetching extraordinary prices, averaging more than 35 cents per pound, the highest ever.5&nbsp;The Great War, which the United States entered in April 1917, was a boon for cotton. Textile mills needed tons of it for uniforms and other goods. The war's end the previous November had opened a broader market for cotton; mills across the world needed it for civilian clothes. Supply was limited as the ineluctable spread of the boll weevil reduced production in many parts of the South, including Georgia. Higher prices, fueled in part by cotton scarcity, helped farmers. The previous month, Congress boosted the price of cotton further by passing an amendment to the federal Cotton Futures Act, making it easier for speculators to make bids.6&nbsp;As global demand for cotton increased, futures skyrocketed. This spike was a windfall for Ruffin and millions of other southern farmers from Virginia to Texas.</p><p>Jenkins County, Georgia, lay in the lower third of a swath of cotton farmland that extended from eastern Virginia into southern Alabama. From colonial days, the region had evolved into a network of plantations, cotton storehouses, and small towns grouped along a major road that later supported a railroad running south from Augusta to the Atlantic port of Savannah. Jenkins was rural and poor, like most counties in the region. Blacks accounted for almost two-thirds of its population.7&nbsp;Many blacks in the county were illiterate, and election records indicate that only a handful were allowed to vote. All county government officials, from commissioners to police, were white.</p><p>Most blacks in Jenkins County were sharecroppers renting land from white landlords, but a growing number owned property, a phenomenon occurring all over the South. In the first decades of the twentieth century, despite the legal barriers imposed by Jim Crow, the number of acres owned by black farmers rose. In Georgia, black ownership jumped by 75 percent from 1899 to 1919.8&nbsp;These landowners formed the "respectable" classes of black society in southern towns. They sat on church boards and led social groups. They generally had good relations with white business owners and politicians, serving as go-betweens when racial friction erupted. In the late morning of this particular April Sunday, Joe Ruffin was the embodiment of this new class, having spent a lifetime navigating the racial restrictions of southern life. Through luck and hard work, he had prospered and never gave "offense to any white man in the county."9</p><p>By the late afternoon of that April 13, however, almost every white man in Jenkins County wanted Joe Ruffin dead.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Around 11:30 a.m., Ruffin's youngest son, Henry, came back to the farm to get his father.10&nbsp;Masons at the festival had asked for him.11&nbsp;Ruffin changed into his best Sunday clothes, then got in his second car&#x2014;a late-model, high-powered Ford touring car&#x2014;and headed down the road. Henry stayed at the farm. The 15-mile drive from Ruffin's farm near Billies Branch to the church was cut with swampy creeks and hollows.12&nbsp;The roads were unpaved. The car drove past acre upon acre of young cotton plants, very low to the ground with thin waxy leaves. Jenkins County is in the middle part of the state near the Savannah River Valley, where Georgia's Piedmont slopes gradually toward the coast. Georgia's famous red clay is sandier in this part of the state and a paler shade of orange. Ruffin could see cultivated land for miles, broken up by copses of loblolly pine and scrub oak as well as thickets of holly and cypress. Hawks and buzzards circled the sky.</p><p>Sometime after 2 p.m., Ruffin reached Big Buckhead Church Road, the final road leading to the festival. The dirt road had been around since the earliest settlers cut through the forest. As he crossed Buckhead Creek Bridge, Big Buckhead Church&#x2014;one of the oldest inland white congregations in the South&#x2014;was on his left. Across the road, mossy obelisk grave markers of Confederate veterans stood in a small cemetery.13&nbsp;In the closing days of the Civil War, when Ruffin was a young boy, Union and Confederate cavalry battled here.14&nbsp;The rebels lost; hundreds were killed.15</p><p>Carswell Grove was founded two and a half years after the battle in the midst of the social turmoil caused by the Confederacy's collapse. After the war, whites at Big Buckhead Church kicked out blacks, who for generations had sat in segregated pews. Porter W. Carswell, a white judge who owned nearby Bellevue Plantation, gave black congregants two acres of scrubland to erect their own place of worship just down the road. The congregants named their new church in his honor. By 1919, Carswell Grove Baptist Church boasted more than a thousand members, most of them sharecroppers. The yearly celebration of the church's founding was one of the largest African American gatherings in east Georgia.</p><p>As Ruffin drove up the low ridge, he saw throngs of black men, women, and children milling about the grounds. They were talking and laughing&#x2014;it was the cacophony of a large, joyous group. Ruffin parked his car and joined them. After a short time, Ruffin remembered that he had left the door to his house unlocked and decided to drive home. He got in his car, but the swelling crowds blocked the road. He drove as far as he could, almost to Big Buckhead Church, when he was forced to stop and wait for people to move along.</p><p>As he sat there, an older Ford drove up behind him and then pulled alongside. People scrambled off the road to get out of the car's way. It stopped abruptly and Ruffin looked over at its occupants: two white lawmen and a distraught black man in handcuffs. Ruffin knew the black man: Edmund Scott, his longtime friend.16&nbsp;The driver was W. Clifford Brown, a Jenkins County police officer. In the back of the car with Scott sat Thomas Stephens, a Millen police night marshal. When he saw Ruffin, Scott frantically shouted to the white officers, "I can get him to stand my bond."17</p><p>Why the two white officers were at the black gathering is unclear. They had no warrant. Marshal Stephens was not even in his jurisdiction. In all likelihood, they were in search of illegal alcohol. Brown and Stephens were known for going after stills and liquor joints known in many parts of the South as "blind tigers."18&nbsp;That spring, the National Prohibition Act was making its way through Congress. It would enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, which banned the sale of liquor nationwide. But in Georgia, the ongoing murky contest between police and those who made, sold, and drank liquor was an old game. In 1907, the Georgia legislature, bowing to pressure from Baptists, passed a law banning alcohol.19&nbsp;The law was enacted partly in response to the Atlanta race riot of 1906, when white mobs attacked blacks for three days. Twenty-five blacks and one white were killed. White opponents of alcohol argued that heavy drinking in downtown saloons had been a catalyst for trouble, which they blamed primarily on blacks. The law, however, did little to suppress Georgia's thirst. By 1919, a thriving underground network of alcohol manufacturers and distributors operated across the state. The police, who were always white, played a running game of cat-and-mouse with still operators, many of whom were black. Sometimes police destroyed confiscated booze. Sometimes corrupt officers resold it. One newspaper reported that Brown, in only three months on the force, filed more than a hundred cases against gamblers and liquor manufacturers. The same report said Brown suspected Scott and the Ruffins of running a still.20</p><p>L. W. Beach, a white superintendent over black sharecroppers at a nearby plantation, told a different story. Beach was at the festival that day, driving impoverished blacks who did not own buggies or wagons to and from the church for one dollar a ride. He said Brown and Stephens were not investigating Scott or Ruffin. The white law officers claimed they arrested Scott, the festival's marshal of ceremonies, only after he brandished a weapon when they almost crashed into his car.21</p><p>Scott, who was driving a minister from another county to the fair, was infuriated by the officer's wild driving. Beach heard Scott say, "That is the way with some people, they haven't got a damn bit of manners." Brown and Stephens then arrested Scott, charging him with possession of an unregistered firearm. They were heading back to the Millen jail with Scott when they passed by Ruffin's car and Scott shouted for help. Officer Brown stopped his car and called for Ruffin. Ruffin got out of his car, walked over and stood on the running board of the police car.</p><p>"What is the trouble with Edmund?" Ruffin asked. Officer Brown said they had found a concealed pistol in Scott's car. Beach, positioned about thirty feet away, saw Ruffin take out a checkbook and offer to write a bond check for his friend. The officer told him he needed cash. Ruffin said he could not get that kind of money, $400, on a Sunday. Brown then said, "God damn it, I am going to carry him in."</p><p>A large crowd immediately gathered around the car, including two of Ruffin's sons, Louis and John Holiday. People who were there said Ruffin reached in and tried to pull Scott out. Brown became incensed and shouted, "God damn it, get back." He pulled out his pistol and struck Ruffin in the face. The gun went off, hitting Ruffin on the left side of his head, knocking him to the dirt. Ruffin said later he was unconscious for a few minutes. Others said he got up right away.</p><p>One person who was there said Louis, Joe's oldest son, rushed the car, wrested the gun from Brown and shot the police officer in the head, neck, and body, killing him. Two others said that the father, Joe Ruffin, killed Brown, pulling out his own pistol and firing into the police car. Others said Officer Stephens, a short, heavyset man, stepped out of the car, hunkered down with his pistol drawn. Another round of gunfire erupted. Scott, caught in the middle and handcuffed, was shot to death as he struggled to get out of the way. Stephens was wounded and slumped to the ground.</p><p>"It was just like a package of poppers [firecrackers]," said Ed Tancemore, a white man who saw the shooting, adding that it took no longer than a finger snap. In an instant, Brown and Scott were dead, slumped in the blood-smeared Ford. Stephens lay on the ground, bleeding but conscious. Black men in the crowd attacked him. Some said Ruffin's two sons led the assault. Tancemore watched as Stephens was beaten: "Every time he would get up, they would knock him back until they got him down the side of the car, and one of them placed his foot in his breast and the other handed him an oak limb, and right there they stopped him."</p><p>Police later found a blood-soaked oak branch beside Stephens's mutilated body. A newspaper account described Stephens as "a shapeless mass."22&nbsp;He took as long as two hours to die.</p><p>Ruffin said that after he was shot, he "fell to the ground and did not know anything at all until my boy J. Holiday and Willie Williams picked me up off the ground, and went walking with me off to my car." Ruffin said his friend Williams tried to hand him the checkbook that he dropped when he was shot. Williams also offered him a gun.</p><p>"No, keep them," Ruffin said. "I have got no use for them now at all. I better go to the doctor because I believe I am going to die."23</p><p>Someone, perhaps one of his sons, perhaps Williams, started Ruffin's Ford. Ruffin sat in the passenger seat, his head gushing with blood, his ears ringing from the gunshots. Smoke stung his nostrils as he looked upon the contorted corpses of a friend he had known his whole life and a white law officer. The other officer, Stephens, writhed on the ground, mortally wounded. Surveying the scene, Ruffin knew immediately he would be lynched when the white mob came for him. And there was no doubt it would come&#x2014;if he lived that long. Word of the incident spread farmhouse by farmhouse across the county. The word traveled along two distinct vectors: black and white. Blacks hid in their homes while hundreds of white men grabbed their guns and headed toward Carswell Grove.</p><p>As Ruffin was rushed from the scene, he asked to be taken to the home of the only person who could help him&#x2014;Jim Perkins, the most powerful white man in Jenkins County, whose farm was three miles from the shooting. Perkins, the chairman of the board of commissioners, had known Ruffin his whole life. Perkins was waiting at a nearby train depot when a black man told him a wounded Joe Ruffin had arrived at his farm. Perkins rushed home.</p><p>Ruffin recalled telling Perkins, "I was only trying to offer him [Brown] a bond for Edmund, and he got mad and shot me down for nothing."</p><p>Perkins remembered Ruffin telling him, "Mr. Brown shot me and it made me so mad I jumped up and emptied my pistol at him."</p><p>Perkins was baffled that Ruffin was in trouble. "I consider he came to me because he didn't know where to ...</p></p><h2>Battleground: The Autobiography of Margaret A. Haley</h2><p>University of Illinois Press, 1982.

She discovered her second love, steamy romance novels, as a teen-first, voraciously reading them and then penning her own. She lives in Hastings, Nebraska.<b> </b></p><p>From Chapter 1 </p><p>Brian, lounging in the center of the table, vocalized a riff, while playing masterful air guitar on his back. Myrna recognized the series of notes at once. She used it in her class discussion on male sensuality, because no one on earth played a guitar more sensuï¿½ally than Master Sinclair. Hold the phone! Could that be...? Nah, what would the rock group Sinners be doing at a college teaching conference? They were probably just fans of the band, though the name Brian made her lead guitarist senses tingle. Wasn't Sinners' lead guitarist named Brian Sinclair? </p><p>One of the men seated in the booth turned his head to scratch his chin with his shoulder. Despite his mirrored sunglasses, she inï¿½stantly recognized vocalist Sedric Lionheart. Her heart rate kicked up a couple notches. It <i>was </i>Sinners. </p><p>"I am so fucking drunk!" Brian yelled. He rolled off the table, knocking over several empty beer glasses, and landed on the laps of two of his companions. They dumped him unceremoniously on the floor. </p><p>Myrna snorted and then glanced around to make sure no one had witnessed her produce such an unladylike sound. She <i>had </i>to go talk to them. She could pretend she wanted to meet them because of her seminar. In truth, she loved their music. They weren't too hard on the eyes either. The definition of exactly her type. Wild. Yes, please. Guaranteed to give her exactly what she needed after the day she'd had. </p><p>Abandoning her plan to hide in her room, Myrna skirted the low wall that separated the lounge area from the corridor. She paused in front of Brian, who was struggling to crawl to his hands and knees. She set her lumpy laptop case on the floor and bent to help him to his feet. The instant she touched his arm, her heart skipped a beat and then began to race. </p><p>Animal magnetism. He had it. <i>Hello, Mr. Welcome Diversion.</i> </p><p>His gaze drifted up her legs and body, his face slowly tilting into view. He had features a sculptor would love: strong jaw, pointed chin, high cheekbones. Would it be presumptuous of her to examine the contours of his face with her fingertips? Her lips? She forced her attention to her hand, which gripped his well-muscled upper arm. </p><p>"Be careful with this arm," she said. "So few guitarists have your skill." </p><p>He used her support to stagger to his feet. When he stumbled against her, she caught his scent and inhaled deeply, her eyes drifting closed. Primal desire bombarded her senses. Did she just growl aloud? </p><p>His strong hands gripped her shoulders as he steadied himself. Every nerve ending in her body shifted into high alert. She couldn't remember that last time she'd been instantaneously attracted to a man. </p><p>Brian released her and leaned against the back of the booth for support. He blinked hard, as if trying to focus his intense, brown eyes on her face. "You know who I am?" he asked, his voice slurred. </p><p>She smiled and nodded eagerly. "Who doesn't?" </p><p>He waved a hand around theatrically, which set him even further off balance. "Every stuffed-shirt geek in the whole damned place, that's who." </p><p>He snarled at a gray-haired woman in a heavy cardigan who sat openly gaping at him. The woman gasped and turned her attention to her ocean blue cocktail, slurping the blended beverage through a tiny, red straw as nonchalantly as possible. </p><p>"Brian, don't start shit," Sed, the group's lead singer, said. </p><p>The acidic look Brian shot at Sed could peel paint. "What? I'm not starting anything. These people all have <i>fuck</i>-king staring problems!" </p><p>True. They were staring. Most of them at Myrna now. Probably wondering how to best rescue her from <i>enemy </i>territory. </p><p>"Do you mind if I sit with you for a while?" Myrna asked, hoping to become less noticeable by sitting. She tucked the lock of hair that had escaped her hairclip behind her ear and smiled at Brian hopefully. He stroked his eyebrow with his index finger as he contemplated her request. She knew what he must be thinking. Why would a stuffy-looking chick in a business suit request to sit with five rock stars? </p><p>Sed scooted over in the semi-circular booth and patted the empty expanse of forest green vinyl beside him. She tugged her gaze from Brian to look at Sed. Sed's boy-next-door good looks contrasted his bad-boy, womanizing reputation. She didn't follow the personal lives of the bands she admired, but even she knew Sed's rep. His smile, complete with dimples, could ice a cake, which was likely why he covered it so rapidly with a scowl. A quick veil of indifference returned his cool status. Those darling dimples didn't quite fit his image. </p><p>Myrna slid into the booth next to Sed, wiping her sweaty palms on her skirt as she settled beside him. <i>Okay, I'm in. Now what?</i> </p><p>"Are you some kind of business woman or something?" Sed leaned back to examine her professional attire. </p><p>Myrna didn't mind his twice over. "Or something. Actually, I'm a stuffed-shirt geek. A college professor here at the conference." </p><p>"No shit?" She recognized the speaker, who sat across from her, as Eric Sticks, the band's drummer. "If I'd have known college proï¿½fessors were hot, I might have considered an education." </p><p>Myrna laughed. She glanced up at Brian who still leaned against the booth next to Eric's right shoulder. Her heart gave a painful throb. God, he was gorgeous. "Would you like to sit down, Brian?" </p><p>Myrna scooted closer to Sed, her knee settling against his beneath the table. Brian collapsed on the seat beside her, lodging her between two of the sexiest and most talented musicians in the business. She'd died and gone to heaven. <i>Play it cool, Myrna. If you start spazzing out like a fan girl, they'll tell you to get lost. </i>And she certainly didn't want that. </p><p>Brian leaned forward and rested his forehead on the table with a groan. It took all of Myrna's concentration not to offer a soothing touch. She knew who he was, but he didn't know her from Adam. Well, hopefully, he could tell her from <i>Adam</i>, but, uh... </p><p>She took a deep breath to collect her scattered thoughts and forced her attention to Eric. She could look at him without getting all giddy, but found she couldn't stop staring at his insane hairstyle-half-long, a center strip of short spikes, the rest various lengths and<br> just plain strange.

It has given the lie to the common misconception that wood is destined to quickly rot and decay, and has demonstrated the enduring value of wood, not to mention the fact that the temple has been designated a World Heritage Site as the earth&#39;s oldest wooden structure. Here Tsunekazu Nishioka, the master carpenter who undertook the repair of this monumental structure in the mid 20th century, share the insights and knowledge he gained from that experience. To make Nishioka&#39;s words and observations more easily understood by later generations, Jiro Kohara has buttressed them with scientific experiments and commentary, bringing into sharp view Horyu-ji&#39;s long-concealed mysteries and secrets. The result is a revealing picture of Japan&#39;s immemorial love of trees and wood, a broad-ranging introduction to the country&#39;s wood culture.</p><p></p><h2>Straight Life: The Story of Art Pepper</h2><p>From rear cover notes: &#34;Art Pepper, 1925-1982.

Each year, thousands of visitors come to the house and gardens, restored just as they were in the house&#39;s heyday and decorated according to Monet&#39;s revolutionary views on colour and light. As she moves through the house, the author describes the mealtime rituals of the yellow dining room, the studio where Monet worked and entertained and the family activities that animated the blue room. She also opens the door to rooms not normally seen by the public: the private bedrooms and the cellar where wine was bottled and fruit preserved. The book focuses on authentic decorative touches, including furniture and fabrics, paint swatches, tiles and china. This is a companion volume to &#34;Monet&#39;s Garden: Through the Seasons at Giverny&#34;.</p><p>Not only was Claude Monet (1840-1926) a leading member of the impressionist movement, he was also, as this charming book reveals, a master interior decorator. A virtual room-by-room guided tour of Monet&#39;s beautiful and much-visited home at Giverny, this volume offers a vivid impression of daily life in the beloved house where the artist lived for 40 years with his second wife and their eight children. With its pink stucco walls, green shutters, and brightly painted original furniture, the house reveals Monet&#39;s brilliance and innovation as a colorist, which transcended his light-infused canvases to inform his choice of hues for wall paint and furniture. Each room is explored in its own chapter with glorious color photos: the dining room, painted in two shades of yellow and adorned with Japanese prints; the blue-and-white-tiled kitchen; the blue drawing room; the studio as it appeared in its heyday. Enlarged paint swatches of Monet&#39;s unique color combinations accompany each chapter so that readers can reproduce them in their own homes.It is a summer's day in the late 1890s and Monet's house at Giverny is in its heyday. Outside, the pink stucco walls are punctuated by brilliant green shutters, and a new green balcony spans the length of the house. Inside, light streams through open windows, illuminating the vibrant, innovative colors Monet chose to color his rooms.<br><br>Here is a guided tour of the house where Monet lived for forty years with the woman who would become his second wife, Alice Hoschedï¿½, and their eight children. The original furniture, much of it painted in vivid hues, is here as well as appointments--china, linen, and small antique collectibles--authentic to what is known of Monet's lifestyle and the period.<br><br>Here is the famous dining room painted in two shades of yellow, embellished with Japanese prints and blue-and-white china. Here is the kitchen with its blue- and-white Rouen tiles and copper pots, the fabled studio where Monet not only painted but entertained his family and friends, the blue drawing room where the family gathered for games, the bedrooms and dressing rooms with their simple and elegant appointments, the foyers, the ï¿½picerie, even the cellar where wine and provisions were stored.

"In the autumn, I intend sending you if I live," wrote Hamilton, then in the throes of searing gout pain, "three kinds of trees which I think you will deem valuable additions to your garden." Hamilton took competitive pride in possessing every possible botanical rarity. Over the course of twenty-five years, he had transformed the Woodlands, his six-hundred-acre estate overlooking the Schuylkill River, into the young nation's premier showcase for exotic plants and trees. Jefferson, himself an ardent gardener, had pronounced his friend Hamilton's country home "the only rival which I have known in America to what may be seen in England."<br><br>Nothing gave Hamilton more joy than showing off his vast greenhouse with its ten thousand plants and his landscaped "natural" pleasure grounds, whose lawns sloped down to the river, artfully "interspersed with artificial groves . . . of trees collected from all parts of the world." He relished his visitors' amazement as they stared at strange "foreign trees from China, Italy, and Turkey," fingering the unusual leaves and bark, inhaling their "balmy odours." As Massachusetts congressman Manasseh Cutler recalled of a visit to the greenhouse: "Every part was crowded with trees and plants, from the hot climates, and such as I have never seen. All the spices. The Tea plant in full perfection. In short, [Hamilton] assured us, there was not a rare plant in Europe, Asia, Africa, from China and the islands in the South Sea, of which he had any account, which he had not procured." Another botanical pilgrim to the Woodlands favored with a personal tour peered in pleasure at "the bread-fruit tree, cinnamon, allspice, pepper, mangoes, different sorts, sago, coffee from Bengal, Arabia, and the West-Indies, tea, green and bohea, mahogany, Japan rose, rose apples. . . . The curious person views it with delight, and the naturalist quits it with regret."<br><br>Hamilton, famous as a genial host and a great talker, was not, however, generous with his green prizes. Once during a dinner party, he entered his greenhouse to pick a special camellia for the table's centerpiece and came upon a young lady with said flower in her hair. Hamilton hurled a curse, exclaiming, "Madam, I had rather have given you one hundred guineas than that you should have plucked that precious blossom." Philadelphia nurseryman Bernard McMahon complained to Jefferson that while he had bestowed upon Hamilton "a great variety of plants . . . he never offered me one in return. . . . I well know his jealousy of any person's attempt to vie with him, in a collection of plants."<br><br>And so it was no small gesture for Hamilton, dismissed by a neighbor as "interested only in his house, his hothouse and his Madeira," to be offering Jefferson among his gifts one of his rarest treasures, an offspring of his "Ginkgo biloba or China Maidenhair tree . . . said by Kaempfer to produce a good eatable nut." In 1784 Hamilton had again bested his plant-collecting rivals, securing before all others in America these exotic ginkgoes with their distinctive fan-shaped leaves. He had sailed to London that year to settle various debts, and while there he had ordered his private secretary back at the Woodlands to "take time by the forelock" and begin sowing seeds in large quantities of native trees such as "white flowering Locust, the sweet or aromatic Birch, the Chestnut Oak, Horsechestnuts, Chinacapins, Judas Trees, Dogwoods, . . . Magnolias," and not to fail to "put into a nursery handsome small plants of Elm, Lime, Locust, sweet Birch, white pine, ash leaved maple, sugar maple, aspen poplar, Zantoxylon or tooth ache tree, magnolia," etc. In a subsequent letter Hamilton asked his secretary about the fate of seeds he had sent home by sea: "Did not any of the seeds vegetate of a Bushel of Horsechestnuts, a peck of Spanish chestnuts, 3 pounds of pistichia, 11 quarts of Portugal Laurel, 5 pound of silver Fir . . . or have they all gone to the Dogs too?" And as winter approached in 1785, he instructed, "Secure the tender plants from the severe weather, otherwise all my pains will have been to no purpose," mentioning specifically his ginkgo.<br><br>The first ginkgo seeds were long believed to have been brought to Europe from Japan in 1693 by Engelbert Kaempfer, a physician-botanist with the Dutch East India Company. Those seeds produced a tree at the Botanic Garden in Utrecht, Holland. By 1754 England's Kew Gardens had acquired its first ginkgo, and today we presume that it was that tree's offspring that came to grace Hamilton's grounds.<br><br>For all Hamilton's considerable botanical mastery, he could not have known, as the leaves of his growing ginkgoes turned a pure yellow each autumn, that this species had been commonplace in the temperate North American forests of the Jurassic age. An abundance of fossils record that the ginkgo tree was among the many fauna and flora of North America that were glaciated out and effectively driven into extinction on the continent by the Ice Age. When Hamilton brought the ginkgo back to one of its former habitats, he was unwittingly reintroducing an evolutionary superstar: Scientists now know that the ginkgo biloba tree or its ancestors have existed on earth for 250 million years, longer than any other tree now living. (Both the eighteenth-century Utrecht and Kew Garden ginkgoes are still alive today.)<br><br>Nor, one suspects, could Hamilton have envisioned how rampantly ginkgo would eventually recolonize the New World, though not as a part of the forests it once dominated. Instead, ginkgo's modern incarnation would be as a cultivated urban tree, an elegant urban denizen valued for its distinctive fan-shaped leaves and above all its ability to grow in the smoggiest of cities, indifferent to poor soil and polluted air, a tree that had also survived whatever pests had once afflicted it in the era when dinosaurs stomped through ginkgo forests.<br><br>Such was Hamilton's reputation as a fanatic plant collector and propagator extraordinaire that on March 22, 1807, Jefferson wrote to alert him that explorer Meriwether Lewis would soon arrive at the Woodlands with packets of some of the precious seeds-"these public treasures"-gathered on the three-year Lewis and Clark expedition. Wrote Jefferson, "I am sure I make the best possible disposition of them." During his presidency Jefferson continued to trade various plants and trees with Hamilton, dispatching to the Woodlands on March 1, 1808, eight aspen trees with "paper whiteness of the body . . . and [stem and leaves] more tremulous." In a long letter the president praised Hamilton, saying, "Your collection is really a noble one, &amp; in making &amp; attending to it you have deserved well of your country." Some thought the less-than-patriotic Hamilton, who had faced two trials and acquittals for treason during the Revolutionary War, was lucky to have held onto his family's estates and the five hundred acres that were the site of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. That town's ground rents, while a never-ending headache to collect, were the basis of his great wealth.<br><br>After Hamilton's death in 1813, the Woodlands declined, as subsequent owners failed to maintain the expensive grounds. Factories, oil refineries, and railroads soon overwhelmed the nearby bucolic landscape, and in 1840 the estate's last owner sold it to a cemetery. Yet the ginkgoes lived on, still such a rarity that not long after the cemetery opened, a young Hudson River nurseryman named Andrew Jackson Downing showed up to wander its new paths in search of these legendary trees. Jackson, twenty-six, soon vaulted to fame as the nation's original home and garden guru, the Martha Stewart of his day, by publishing his Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (1841). The first such book aimed at an American audience, it would eventually go through eight editions and sixteen printings.<br><br>A slight, poetic man with intense brown eyes, dark, curling locks, and a square jaw with a dimpled chin, Downing had strong opinions about tasteful architecture, the intricacies of pomology (apple raising), and the necessity of beauty in gardens and everyday life. The youngest of five children, he had grown up in Newburgh, New York, with a beautiful view of the Hudson River and the mountains. He completed school at sixteen and went to work in the family's commercial nursery, situated on the ten acres surrounding its home and offering customers hundreds of varieties of apple, pear, peach, and cherry trees. In 1838, at age twenty-four, Downing married Caroline Elizabeth DeWint, whose mother was a niece of John Quincy Adams.<br><br>During regular visits to nearby wealthy estates as part of that work, Downing came to know and admire a number of ardent gardeners, including Henry Sargent, a wealthy New York banker who was beautifying his new estate, Wodenethe, across the Hudson. Sargent and other clients became friends, opening Downing's eyes to a world of aesthetics, culture, and knowledge that he would embrace and share with other aspiring Americans through his writings and landscape design.<br><br>After locating Hamilton's fifty-six-year-old ginkgoes amid the new Woodlands Cemetery grave sites, Downing described the tallest as being fifty-five feet high and three feet, four inches in circumference. Another famous ginkgo, not as tall, could be admired in Boston, wrote Downing, "standing on the north side of that fine public square, the Boston Common. It originally grew in the grounds of Gardiner Green, Esq. of Boston; but though of fine size, it was about three years since, carefully removed to its present site, which proves its capability for bearing transplanting. Its measurement is forty feet in elevation, and nearly four in circumference." Through Henry Sargent the up-and-coming Downing would meet horticulturally inclined Boston Brahmans, including (we speculate) a very young second cousin of Henry's named Charles Sprague Sargent, who decades later would become America's most influential tree expert.<br><br>As Downing became famous, a steady stream of visitors began to appear to admire his faux-sandstone Elizabethan villa and parklike gardens on the family land in Newburgh. They described a slight, almost Spanish-looking man of "easy elegance," who with his lovely wife (they had no children) "seem to live for the beautiful and the agreeable in life amid a select circle of friends . . . and a cheerful and unembarrassed social intercourse seems to characterize the life of this circle." In contrast to William Hamilton, who was stingy with his plants and flowers, a guest of Downing's who exclaimed in pleasure over a creamy magnolia blossom would soon find one perfuming his place at the breakfast table each morning for the rest of his stay. One observant guest noticed that amid all this ease, lush gardens, and laden fruit trees, Downing, a passionate tree lover, was in his study very early working, and often returned there long after guests were asleep.<br><br>And so we like to imagine Downing toiling discreetly away before dawn some fine morning, writing in his Treatise about the ginkgo: "This fine exotic tree, which appears to be perfectly hardy in this climate, is one of the most singular in its foliage that has ever come under our observation. . . . The fruit is a drupe, about an inch in length, containing a nut. . . . They are eaten after having been roasted or boiled, and are considered excellent." Or so he had read, for when Downing wrote this, no female ginkgo in America had yet reached puberty and begun the tree's uniquely active sex life. "Abroad," he noted, the ginkgo "has fruited in the south of France, and young trees have been reared from the nuts." "The ginkgo tree," added Downing, "is so great a botanical curiosity, and is so singularly beautiful when clad with its fern-like foliage, that it is strikingly adapted to add ornament and interest to the pleasure ground." Of course, he soon installed one of these lovelies in his garden.<br><br>The ginkgo was by no means Hamilton's only big arboreal claim to fame and urban legacy. For in the same year-1784-that he sent his ginkgoes back to the Woodlands, he also secured his other great Oriental novelty: the tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) from northern China. There ailanthus was more than just an ornamental fast grower. Its wood was well suited to the kitchen steamers basic to all Chinese cuisine, while one treatment for mental illness called for an elixir of ground-up ailanthus root mixed with two liters of the urine of small boys and a paste of black soybean and various other medicinal herbs, left overnight, boiled, and then administered once daily. For balding men hoping to stimulate hair growth, pharmacists proposed a pulverized mixture of ailanthus, peach, and catalpa leaves, their extracted juice smeared on bald spots.<br><br>Like the ginkgo, the ailanthus had a colorful provenance. In the mideighteenth century the Chinese imperial court banned foreigners from the Celestial Kingdom, except for certain seaports. However, the emperor did accept the presence in Peking of a handful of French Jesuit priests, well schooled in science and technology. One, Father Pierre Nicolas Le Chï¿½ron d'Incarville, joined the mission in 1740 at age thirty-four. He had studied botany under Bernard de Jussieu, superintendent of the Jardin Royal des Plantes in Paris. Arriving in Macao and traveling up through South China to Peking, d'Incarville soon began sending herbarium specimens and seeds back to Jussieu as best he could. Mistaking the ailanthus for the highly valued Chinese varnish tree-their slender, pinnately compound leaves are very similar-in 1751 he sent a supply of the ailanthus's papery seeds back to Paris.<br><br>In France, Jussieu planted some and dispatched a few more across the Channel to the Royal Society. English nurseryman Philip Miller of the Chelsea Physic Garden sowed some of them and watched his little trees of heaven grow at a prodigious rate, three to five feet a year until they reached sixty feet tall, with plentiful suckers (growths from the roots) that made it easy to raise yet more trees. The tree was already popular in Europe when Hamilton dispatched one home so that he could become the proud first possessor in America of this rarity.<br><br>Also like the ginkgo, the ailanthus was destined to become an American city tree par excellence. But while the ginkgo grew at such a slow pace that it remained a precious collectible for another century, the tree of heaven would enter the nursery trade by the 1820s, heavily promoted by the Robert Prince Nursery of Flushing, New York, for its rapid growth, frothy foliage, and indifference to coal smoke and insects. Downing, in his Treatise, championed the exuberant ailanthus, enthusing that, in its first half dozen years of life, it "outstrips almost any other deciduous tree in vigour of growth, and we have measured leading stems which had grown twelve or fifteen feet in a single season. . . . There are, as yet, no specimens in this country more than 70 feet high; but the trunk shoots up in a fine column, and the head is massy and irregular." Unlike ginkgoes, ailanthus rarely live more than sixty years, and Downing made no mention of having seen any when he visited the Woodlands Cemetery. By then, Hamilton's original ailanthus specimens may have perished but certainly would have sired many hundreds, if not thousands, of offspring.</p><h2>Batman: The Golden Age Vol. 6</h2><p><b>The adventures of Batman and Robin reach the mid-1940s with these fast-paced tales.</b><br><br>Gotham's famed Caped Crusader, Batman, is joined by Robin, the Boy Wonder, in these classic tales from the Golden Age of comics.

Several youngish broker types were chatting about nothing, and one of them said, "You know, the guys in my office are always complaining about how tough life is, how hard it is to make ends meet. I'm just sick of hearing it." By comparison to the experience of the boys in SLEEPERS, this smug bastard had life handed to him on a silver platter and it still wasn't good enough. Life was so good for him that he was simply beyond hearing about someone else's reality. That contrast caused the tears, and I only wish I'd had the courage to say something. <br><br>I should also say, and maybe I shouldn't, that while the movie had its good points, reading the book is a far more satisfying experience, tears and all. I don't think that anyone who reads Sleepers can come away unchanged. It isn't for the weak of stomach, but in the same sense that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a tough movie to watch, imagine having to live through it. That's why we read, and that's why some of us come to publishing.<br><br>Sheila Phelan, Director of Circulation<b>Lorenzo Carcaterra</b> is the author of <b>A Safe Place: The True Story of a Father, a Son, a Murder</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is married and has two children.</p><h2>AKC STAR Puppy: A Positive Behavioral Approach to Puppy Training</h2><p>Give your new puppy a great start in life by following the easy-to-apply information in this book from the moment you bring her home.

A unique memoir of the first half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of one born to be an absolute monarch, the book begins with the author's vivid account of the last, decadent days of the Ching Dynasty, and closes with an introspective self-portrait of the last Ching emperor transformed into a retiring scholar and citizen of the People's Republic of China. <p> In detailing the events of the fifty years between his ascension to the throne and the final period of his life as a quiet-living resident of Beijing. Pu Yi reveals himself to be first and foremost a survivor, caught up in the torrent of global power struggles and world conflict that played itself out on the Asian continent through many decades of violence and upheaval. </p><p> This firsthand description of the dramatic events of Pu Yi's life was the basis for the internationally acclaimed 1987 Bernardo Bertolucci film The Last Emperor which was named Best Picture of the Year by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. From Emperor to Citizen readily lends itself to cinematic adaptation as a personal narrative of continuously significant and revealing episodes. </p><p> Becoming emperor and then forced to abdicate with the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, all before he is seven continues to live in Forbidden City for another decade still treated as the Son of Heaven by the moribund Ching court, but in reality a virtual prisoner, with little genuine human contact apart from his beloved nurse Mrs. Wang, his teacher Chen Pao-shen and his English tutor Reginald Johnston. </p><p> When at the age of nineteen Pu Yi is finally forced to vacate his isolated existence within the Forbidden City, he begins his long odyssey as the dependent of the occupying imperial Japanese regime, first in Tientsin, and eventually installed as "emperor" of the Japanese puppet state styled Manchukuo in China's northeast provinces. With the defeat of Japan and the end of the Second World War, Pu Yi faces a very uncertain future as he is shunted off to Russia for five years before returning to a new China transformed by revolution, where he is confined in the Fushun War Criminal Prison. Here he undergoes several years of rehabilitation, "learning how to become a human being," as he calls it, before receiving an official pardon and being allowed to finally live as an ordinary citizen of Beijing. </p><p> This autobiography is the culmination of a unique and remarkable life, told simply, directly and frankly by a man whose circumstances and experiences were like no other.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Chogyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision</h2><p>Master of meditation, artist, poet, social visionary&#x2014;Chï¿½gyam Trungpa was all these and more. Yet "Who was Chï¿½gyam Trungpa?" is a slippery question, for who can nail down the personality of a man who by all accounts seemed to be a different person to different people at different times and on different occasions? Fabrice Midal, by steering his way between conventional Western biography and traditional Tibetan hagiography, has succeeded in painting a detailed portrait of this unconventional Tibetan lama, who is regarded as one of the most influential forces in transporting Buddhism to the West. <br><br>From his first years of teaching in Britain and the United States, Trungpa began making friends with and teaching his students in a completely free style, with few Buddhist references, adapted to the language and understanding of young Westerners. Yet his radical emphasis was on the traditional source of Buddhism: the root practice of sitting meditation. <br><br>In his oral teachings, Trungpa surprised his audiences by making no concession to their expectations, speaking directly from his heart to their hearts, without alluding to techniques and philosophy. <br><br>His work was unique in its emphasis on a secular rather than religious approach to spirituality. Among the practices that he encouraged his students to undertake were calligraphy, flower arranging, Japanese archery, tea ceremony, dance, theater, health care, psychotherapy, poetry, elocution, and translation. His founding of centers, communities, and innovative educational institutions was also part of the flowering of a new culture of Buddhism in the West. He founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado; Shambhala Training; and Vajradhatu, an international association of meditation centers (now called Shambhala International). <br><br>This biography presents a wealth of anecdotes from Trungpa's life, excerpts from unpublished talks, reminiscences by those closest to him, and facts from the archive that preserves his legacy&#x2014;all making the book a treasure chest of insights and teachings not found in any other book published so far.</p><p>Fabrice Midal is a professor of philosophy at the University of Paris. He holds a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Paris, Sorbonne, and teaches the dharma in France and elsewhere in Europe. A practicing Buddhist in the tradition of Chï¿½gyam Trungpa, he is well known in Buddhist circles in France and has published books on religious topics with major French publishers, among them several titles on Tibetan Buddhism."This is precisely the book about Trungpa Rinpoche that has been needed for a long time. I feel that it is absolutely what Rinpoche would have wanted written about his major accomplishments and teachings. My husband was so brilliant in being able to use many different media to express his teachings. Rinpoche demonstrated that the awakened mind can be expressed in many ways, through various art forms, as well as in all the forms and details of everyday life. His approach made the buddhadharma available to all kinds of people who have different interests in their lives. As well, it is a hallmark of the vajrayana teachings that you fully engage everything in your world. My husband was a master of this, and Fabrice Midal has beautifully captured this quality in his book."&#x2014;from the Foreword by Diana J. Mukpo</p><h2>I Need Your Love - Is That True?: How to Stop Seeking Love, Approval, and Appreciation and Start Finding Them Instead</h2><p>In <i>Loving What Is</i>, bestselling author Byron Katie introduced thousands of people to her simple and profound method of finding happiness through questioning the mind. Now, <i>I Need Your Love</i>&#x2014;<i>Is That True?</i> examines a universal, age-old source of anxiety: our relationships with others. In this groundbreaking book, Katie helps you question everything you have been taught to do to gain love and approval. In doing this, you discover how to find genuine love and connection. <br><br>The usual advice offered in self-help books and reinforced by our culture advocates a stressful, all-consuming quest for love and approval. We are advised to learn self-marketing and manipulative skills&#x2014;how to attract, impress, seduce, and often pretend to be something we aren&#x2019;t. This approach doesn&#x2019;t work. It leaves millions of walking wounded&#x2014;those who, having failed to find love or appreciation, blame themselves and conclude that they are unworthy of love. <br><br><i>I Need Your Love</i>&#x2014;<i>Is That True?</i> helps you illuminate every area in your life where you seem to lack what you long for most&#x2014;the love of your spouse, the respect of your child, a lover&#x2019;s tenderness, or the esteem of your boss. Through its penetrating inquiry, you will quickly discover the falseness of the accepted ways of seeking love and approval, and also of the mythology that equates love with need. Using the method in this book, you will inquire into painful beliefs that you&#x2019;ve based your whole life on&#x2014;and be delighted to see them evaporate. Katie shows you how unraveling the knots in the search for love, approval, and appreciation brings real love and puts you in charge of your own happiness.<br>&#x201c;Everyone agrees that love is wonderful, except when it&#x2019;s terrible. People spend their whole lives tantalized by love&#x2014;seeking it, trying to hold on to it, or trying to get over it. Not far behind love, as major preoccupations, come approval and appreciation. From childhood on, most people spend much of their energy in a relentless pursuit of these things, trying out different methods to be noticed, to please, to impress, and to win other people&#x2019;s love, thinking that&#x2019;s just the way life is. This effort can become so constant and unquestioned that we barely notice it anymore.<br><br>This book takes a close look at what works and what doesn&#x2019;t in the quest for love and approval. It will help you find a way to be happier in love and more effective in all your relationships. What you learn here will bring fulfillment to all kinds of relationships, including romantic love, dating, marriage, work, and friendship.&#x201d; &#x2014;Byron Katie<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Byron Katie</b> (she was born Byron Kathleen Reid, and everyone calls her Katie) discovered inquiry in 1986. Everything in this book comes from <i>The Work of Byron Katie</i>, her remarkable method for finding happiness and freedom. Katie has been traveling around the world for more than a dozen years teaching <i>The Work</i> directly to hundreds of thousands of people. In addition, she has introduced The Work into business settings, universities, schools, churches, prisons, and hospitals. Her website is www.thework.com, where you will find her schedule, articles about her, registration forms, and basic information about <i>The Work</i>.<b>1: DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU THINK?</b><br><br>Have you ever felt that the harder you look for love, the more it seems to elude you? Or that seeking approval makes you feel insecure? If you have, there's a reason. It's because seeking love and approval is a sure way to lose the awareness of both. You can lose the awareness of love, but never love itself. Love is what we are. So, if love is what we are, why do we look for it so hard, and often with such poor results? Only because of what we think&#x2014;the thoughts we believe that are not true.<br><br>You don't have to believe any of this. You can verify it for yourself as you read this book or when you put the book down and ask four questions about your own relationships, or lack of them, and discover how your life changes.<br><br>In the pursuit of love, approval, and appreciation, what do we think? We think that the love and approval of others are the keys to the kingdom&#x2014;to every good thing in the world. We think that seeking romance brings love, a sexual partner, long-term closeness, marriage, family. And we think that trying to impress society&#x2014;trying to win the admiration of the right people&#x2014;is our best shot at bringing fame, wealth, and satisfaction into our lives.<br><br>So we think that if we succeed in the quest, we're home: safe, warm, and appreciated. And what if we fail? We're homeless, out in the cold, lost in the crowd, unnoticed, lonely, and forgotten. If those are the stakes, no wonder the quest can be so fearful and all-consuming. No wonder a compliment can make your day and a harsh word can ruin it.<br><br>The big, primitive fears rarely rise to the surface. Few people walk around actually thinking that they're about to fall through the cracks of society and vanish. Instead, thousands of anxious thoughts appear all day long: "Was I noticed?" "Why didn't she smile?" "Did I make a good impression?" "Why hasn't he returned my call?" "Do I look okay?" "Should I have said that?" "What do they think of me now?" It's a constant monitoring to see if we're gaining or losing ground in the grand approval sweepstakes. Those little doubts are rarely noticed or questioned, and yet they set in motion hundreds of strategies designed to win favor and admiration, or just to please. The unspoken belief is that unless people approve of you, you're worthless.<br><br>The irony is that the struggle to win love and approval makes it very difficult to experience them. Chronic approval seekers don't realize that they are loved and supported not because of but despite their efforts. And the more strenuously they seek, the less likely they are to notice.<br><br>How do we get into this predicament? For a few pages, we'll just look at the ways unquestioned thoughts create our experience. We'll see how often-unnoticed thoughts that most of us share lead us to needing, wanting, longing, and reaching for what we already have. The thoughts behind a familiar 3 a.m. anxiety attack are a good place to start.<br><br>Thought at 3 a.m.: Nothing Supports Me<br><br>Suddenly you wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the clock, and wish you were still asleep. A thought appears: "What's going to happen to me? It's a cold, uncaring universe. I don't know what to do." These thoughts were triggered by a mutual-fund commercial you saw last night, but you don't realize that. And the next ones come from a half-remembered motivational tape: "There are no guarantees in this world. Nothing's going to happen for you unless you make it happen." This thought provides a little boost, followed by a major deflation as you remember that self-reliance hasn't worked all that well for you. "I need so much. I have so few resources to get it. My survival skills aren't great, and basically I'm faking it. I'm helpless and alone. " The next thought brings some hope: "If I could just get more love from my family and friends, if just one person really adored me, if my boss really believed in me, then I wouldn't be so anxious, and I could count on being supported."<br><br>The thought "Nothing supports me without my efforts" is just one of the unquestioned and often unnoticed beliefs that set in motion the search for love and approval. Let's pause for a moment and explore the opposite.<br><br>Daylight Reality Check:Everything Supports Me<br><br>Do you know what supports your existence right now?<br><br>Just to scratch the surface of this, suppose you've eaten your breakfast, sat down in your favorite chair, and picked up this book. Your neck and shoulders support your head. The bones and muscles of your chest support your breathing. Your chair supports your body. The floor supports your chair. The earth supports the building you live in. Various stars and planets hold the earth in its orbit. Outside your window a man walks down the street with his dog. Can you be sure that he isn't playing a part in your support? He may work every day in a cubicle, filing papers for the power company that makes your lights come on.<br><br>Among the people you see on the street, and the countless hands and eyes working behind the scenes, can you be sure that there is anyone who isn't supporting your existence? The same question applies to the generations of ancestors who preceded you and to the various plants and animals that had something to do with your breakfast. How many unlikely coincidences allow you to be here!<br><br>To explore this for a while, look around and see if there is anything you can say for sure doesn't play some role in supporting you. Now look again at the 3 a.m. thought "Nothing supports me without my efforts." In this moment wouldn't it be more true to say, "Everything supports me without my efforts"? The proof is that here you are, sitting in your chair, doing nothing, being fully supported.<br><br>Everything supports you whether or not you even notice it, whether or not you think about it or understand it, whether you love it or hate it, whether you're happy or sad, asleep or awake, motivated or unmotivated. It just supports you without asking for anything in return.<br><br>Right now, sitting in your chair, as you breathe, notice that you're not doing the breathing, you're being breathed. You don't even have to be aware of it, you don't even have to remember to breathe, because that is supported too. Complicated and intricate as your requirements for existence might be, they are all being met. At this moment there's nothing you need, nothing you need to do. Notice how it feels to take in that thought.<br><br>Now think of something you don't have. I'm sure you can think of something. . .<br><br><i>The Thought That Kicks You Out of Heaven</i><br><br>The thought that kicks you out of heaven could be "I'd be a little more comfortable if I had a pillow." Or it could be "I'd be happier if my partner were here."<br><br>Without that thought, you're in heaven&#x2014;just sitting in your chair, being supported and being breathed. When you believe the thought that something is missing, what do you experience? The immediate effect may be subtle&#x2014;only a slight restlessness as your attention moves away from what you already have. But with that shift of attention, you give up the peace you have as you sit in your chair. Seeking comfort, you give yourself discomfort.<br><br>What if you did get a pillow? That could work (if you have a pillow). You may find yourself back in heaven again. It may be the very thing you needed. Or you could pick up the phone and convince your partner (if you have a partner) to join you, and maybe he or she would actually arrive. And perhaps you would be happier, and perhaps you wouldn't. In the meantime, there goes your peace.<br><br>The thought that kicks you out of heaven doesn't have to be about comfort or happiness. It could be "I'd be more secure if . . ." or "If only it could always be like this," or it could be just the thought of a cup of coffee. Most people are so busy making improvements they don't notice they've stepped out of heaven. Wherever they are, something or someone could always be better.<br><br>So, how do you get back to heaven? To begin with, just notice the thoughts that take you away from it. You don't have to believe everything your thoughts tell you. Just become familiar with the particular thoughts you use to deprive yourself of happiness. It may seem strange at first to get to know yourself in this way, but becoming familiar with your stressful thoughts will show you the way home to everything you need.<br><br><i>Getting to Know You</i><br><br>When you begin to notice your thoughts, one of the first things you'll see is that you're never alone. You're not alone with your lover or with anyone else; you're not even alone with yourself. Wherever you go, whomever you're with, the voice in your head goes with you, whispering, nagging, enticing, judging, chattering, shaming, guilt-tripping, or yelling at you. When you wake up in the morning, your thoughts wake up with you. They push you out of bed and follow you to work. They make comments about people at the office and people in the store. They follow you to the bathroom, get into your car when you do, and come back home again with you. Whether or not someone is waiting for you at home, your thoughts will be there waiting for you.<br><br>If you're afraid to be alone, it means you're afraid of your thoughts. If you loved your thoughts, you would love to be alone anywhere with them; you wouldn't have to turn on the radio when you get in the car, or the TV when you get home. The way you relate to your thoughts&#x2014;that's what you bring to every relationship you have, including the one with yourself.<br><br><i>But Wait a Minute!</i><br><br>You may be asking: "That voice in my head, isn't it me? Don't I think my thoughts?" You can answer this for yourself. If the voice in your head is you, who's the one listening to it?<br><br>When you wake up in the morning, you may notice that by the time you realize you're thinking, you're already being thought. Thoughts just appear. You're not doing them. Occasionally you may have the experience of waking up before your thoughts. The mind spins for a few seconds seeking to know what it is, and then the world restarts in your thoughts, piece by piece. "I am so and so. This is Philadelphia. That person next to me is my husband. It's Tuesday. I need to get up and go to work." That process happens continuously when you're awake. Thoughts create your world and your identity in every moment.<br><br><i>What Do Your Thoughts Have to Say About Love?<br></i><br>If you listen to your thoughts, you'll notice that they are telling you what love can do for you. For instance, after a disappointment in love, you may have a raw and exposed feeling. Your thoughts may tell you that you've been deprived, that you are abandoned, excluded, empty, lonely, or incomplete. They may tell you that only love can make you feel good again. If you're fearful, if you crave safety and security, your thoughts may tell you that love will rescue you. If life is disappointing or doesn't make sense, many people think that love is the answer to that as well. It would be useful at this point to see what you think. Just ask yourself what you hope for or expect from love, and make a list of five things you think love will bring you.<br><br>Most people believe that love and need are synonymous. "I love you, I need you" is the hook of a thousand love songs.<br><br>If you ask yourself what you really need in life, you'll probably come up with a list like the one you just made about love. People ask for the same things as they go through life. The way they ask just gets a little more sophisticated:<br><br>Mommmyyyy!<br><br>Mine!<br><br>Gimme!<br><br>I want . . .<br><br>I need . . .<br><br>Please . . .<br><br>I need your love.<br><br>You're not fulfilling my needs in this relationship.<br><br>I need you to . . .<br><br>I can't go on without . . .<br><br>These are my requirements . . .<br><br>Thoughts about your wants and needs can be very bossy. If you believe them, you feel you have to do what they say&#x2014;you have to get people's love and approval. There is another way to respond to a thought, and that is to question it. How can you question your wants and needs? How can you meet your thoughts without believing them?<br><br>I meet my thoughts the way I would meet my husband or my children: with understanding.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Sun: Jump Into Science</h2><p>How hot is the sun?

Or half a king, at least.<br> A seeking wind, the Gettlanders called it, for it found out every chink and keyhole, moaning Mother Sea&#x2019;s dead chill into every dwelling, no matter how high the fires were banked or how close the folk were huddled.<br> It tore at the shutters in the narrow windows of Mother Gundring&#x2019;s chambers and rattled even the iron--bound door in its frame. It taunted the flames in the firepit and they spat and crackled in their anger, casting clawing shadows from the dried herbs hanging, throwing flickering light upon the root that Mother Gundring held up in her knobbled fingers.<br> &#x201c;And this?&#x201d;<br> It looked like nothing so much as a clod of dirt, but Yarvi had learned better. &#x201c;Black--tongue root.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And why might a minister reach for it, my prince?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;A minister hopes they won&#x2019;t have to. Boiled in water it can&#x2019;t be seen or tasted, but is a most deadly poison.&#x201d;<br> Mother Gundring tossed the root aside. &#x201c;Ministers must sometimes reach for dark things.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ministers must find the lesser evil,&#x201d; said Yarvi.<br> &#x201c;And weigh the greater good. Five right from five.&#x201d; Mother Gundring gave a single approving nod and Yarvi flushed with pride. The approval of Gettland&#x2019;s minister was not easily won. &#x201c;And the riddles on the test will be easier.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The test.&#x201d; Yarvi rubbed nervously at the crooked palm of his bad hand with the thumb of his good.<br> &#x201c;You will pass.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be sure.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is a minister&#x2019;s place always to doubt&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But always to seem certain,&#x201d; he finished for her.<br> &#x201c;See? I know you.&#x201d; That was true. No one knew him better, even in his own family. Especially in his own family. &#x201c;I have never had a sharper pupil. You will pass at the first asking.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll be Prince Yarvi no more.&#x201d; All he felt at that thought was relief. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have no family and no birthright.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You will be Brother Yarvi, and your family will be the Ministry.&#x201d; The firelight found the creases about Mother Gundring&#x2019;s eyes as she smiled. &#x201c;Your birthright will be the plants and the books and the soft word spoken. You will remember and advise, heal and speak truth, know the secret ways and smooth the path for Father Peace in every tongue. As I have tried to do. There is no nobler work, whatever nonsense the muscle--smothered fools spout in the training square.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The muscle--smothered fools are harder to ignore when you&#x2019;re in the square with them.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; She curled her tongue and spat into the fire. &#x201c;Once you pass the test you only need go there to tend a broken head when the play gets too rough. One day you will carry my staff.&#x201d; She nodded toward the tapering length of studded and slotted elf--metal which leaned against the wall. &#x201c;One day you will sit beside the Black Chair, and be Father Yarvi.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Father Yarvi.&#x201d; He squirmed on his stool at that thought. &#x201c;I lack the wisdom.&#x201d; He meant he lacked the courage, but lacked the courage to admit it.<br> &#x201c;Wisdom can be learned, my prince.&#x201d;<br> He held his left hand, such as it was, up to the light. &#x201c;And hands? Can you teach those?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You may lack a hand, but the gods have given you rarer gifts.&#x201d;<br> He snorted. &#x201c;My fine singing voice, you mean?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why not? And a quick mind, and empathy, and strength. Only the kind of strength that makes a great minister, rather than a great king. You have been touched by Father Peace, Yarvi. Always remember: strong men are many, wise men are few.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No doubt why women make better ministers.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And better tea, in general.&#x201d; Gundring slurped from the cup he brought her every evening, and nodded approval again. &#x201c;But the making of tea is another of your mighty talents.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hero&#x2019;s work indeed. Will you give me less flattery when I&#x2019;ve turned from prince into minister?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You will get such flattery as you deserve, and my foot in your arse the rest of the time.&#x201d;<br> Yarvi sighed. &#x201c;Some things never change.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Now to history.&#x201d; Mother Gundring slid one of the books from its shelf, stones set into the gilded spine winking red and green.<br> &#x201c;Now? I have to be up with Mother Sun to feed your doves. I was hoping to get some sleep before&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you sleep when you&#x2019;ve passed the test.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No you won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She licked one finger, ancient paper crackling as she turned the pages. &#x201c;Tell me, my prince, into how many splinters did the elves break God?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Four hundred and nine. The four hundred Small Gods, the six Tall Gods, the first man and woman, and Death, who guards the Last Door. But isn&#x2019;t this more the business of a prayer--weaver than a minister?&#x201d;<br> Mother Gundring clicked her tongue. &#x201c;All knowledge is the business of the minister, for only what is known can be controlled. Name the six Tall Gods.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Mother Sea and Father Earth, Mother Sun and Father Moon, Mother War and&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> The door banged wide and that seeking wind tore through the chamber. The flames in the firepit jumped as Yarvi did, dancing distorted in the hundred hundred jars and bottles on the shelves. A figure blundered up the steps, setting the bunches of plants swinging like hanged men behind him.<br> It was Yarvi&#x2019;s Uncle Odem, hair plastered to his pale face with the rain and his chest heaving. He stared at Yarvi, eyes wide, and opened his mouth but made no sound. One needed no gift of empathy to see he was weighed down by heavy news.<br> &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; croaked Yarvi, his throat tight with fear.<br> His uncle dropped to his knees, hands on the greasy straw. He bowed his head, and spoke two words, low and raw.<br> &#x201c;My king.&#x201d;<br> And Yarvi knew his father and brother were dead.</p><h2>Yellow Brick War - Target Signed Edition (Dorothy Must Die)</h2><p>SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR.

While pursuing his quarry, Captain Drake finds himself beset by memories of his early days as a young and idealistic knight in King Roderick&#39;s service. Featured as flashbacks, these memories provide readers with important clues to the unfolding story, such as that the King&#39;s Dragons were more loyal to the palace chamberlain, Maarten Greyfalcon, than to the king; that there was a mysterious letter written by the king, meant to be read only at his death, which had disappeared; and that Drake had uncovered a plot to murder the king. The tale moves forward in both the present and the past, with the flashbacks drawn in black-and-white to differentiate the time. As with the very successful and well-reviewed first three titles by award-winning cartoonist Scott Chantler, high action propels this fast-moving story forward, with sword fighting, chase scenes and a bold and daring narrow escape, while intricate plotlines full of intrigue and suspense (and occasional witty banter) keep the reader guessing. The art is dramatic and evocative, offering emotional close-ups, telling details and believable backdrops. This is a wonderful graphic novel that will engage reluctant readers, providing a painless way to dive into literature and learn about plot, character, setting and other literary devices.</p><p>Scott Chantler is an award-winning cartoonist and commercial illustrator. He lives in Waterloo, Ontario.Gr 6 Up&#x2014;The fourth volume in the series, this title nicely weaves the tale of an honorable knight's search for three fugitives. Chantler, a Joe Shuster Award-winning cartoonist, amusingly captures the adventures of Captain Drake, an idealistic knight in service to his monarch. In black-and-white flashbacks neatly interspersed with the current narrative, readers witness the protagonist's initial knighting. He then learns that not every King's Dragon (knight) is truly in service to the crown. The color panels reveal that Drake is now operating without formal guidance. His search brings him back in contact with his former leader, and the hero must confront some of his concerns and issues with trust. Prettily drawn, in a style reminiscent of the "Prince Valiant" comics, The King's Dragon can almost stand alone. Still, those who wish to read the whole tale will need to order the first three installments and commit to purchasing future volumes. Given the popularity of complex monarchal stories for adults&#x2014;such as Game of Thrones&#x2014;this series serves middle and high school students interested in the same genre.&#x2014;Sarah Knutson, American Canyon Middle School, CA</p><h2>What The Bible Says About Being A Man</h2><p>This was the 1st edition of this book and is out of print permanently.

It is the first serious book to fully engage astrology in this way.Astrology is the oldest of the occult sciences. It is also the origin of science itself. Astronomy, mathematics, and other disciplines arose in part to make possible the calculations necessary in casting horoscopes. For five thousand years, from the ancient Near East to the modern world, the influence of the stars has been viewed as shaping the course and destiny of human affairs. According to recent polls, at least 30 percent of the American public believes in astrology, though, as Bobrick reveals, modern astrology is also utterly different from the doctrine of the stars that won the respect and allegiance of the greatest thinkers, scientists, and writers -- Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Arab, and Persian -- of an earlier day. Statesmen, popes, and kings once embraced it, and no less a figure than St. Thomas Aquinas, the medieval theologian, thought it not incompatible with Christian faith. There are some two hundred astrological allusions in Shakespeare&#39;s plays, and not one of their astrological predictions goes unfulfilled. The great astronomers of the scientific revolution -- Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler -- were adherents. Isaac Newton&#39;s appetite for mathematics was first whetted by an astrological text. In more recent times, prominent figures such as Churchill, de Gaulle, and Reagan have consulted astrologers and sometimes heeded their advice. Today universities as diverse as Oxford in England and the University of Zaragoza in Spain offer courses in the subject, fulfilling Carl Jung&#39;s prediction decades ago that astrology would again become the subject of serious discourse. Whether astrology actually has the powers that have been ascribed to it is, of course, open to debate. But there is no doubt that it maintains an unshakeable hold on the human mind. In The Fated Sky, Benson Bobrick has written an absolutely captivating and comprehensive account of this engrossing subject and its enduring influence on history and the history of ideas.</p><p><b>Benson Bobrick</b> earned his doctorate from Columbia University and is the author of several critically acclaimed works, including <i>Wide as the Waters: The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired</i>, <i>Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution</i>, and <i>Testament: A Soldier's Story of the Civil War</i>. In 2002 he received the Literature Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He and his wife, Hilary, divide their time between New York and Vermont.<b>Chapter One</b><p></p><p>America would never have been discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 had it not been for the thought of Arab astrologers in Baghdad in the 9th century A.D. When Columbus set sail on the great western voyage that carried him to America's shores, he had biblical prophecy to inspire him, Arab astrology to guide him, and various practical aids that three continental astrologers, who were also mathematicians, had supplied: the planetary tables of Regiomontanus; a map drawn up by Paolo Toscanelli; and an ephemeris prepared by Samuel Zacuto, who later made the splendid astrolabe of iron used by Vasco da Gama in his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. These were all of use to Columbus in his celestial calculations and his navigation of the open sea. He also used an astrolabe and quadrant to determine the altitude of stars, set his hourglass by the transits of the Sun, depended on the North Star to fix magnetic north, and judged the time of night by the constellation of the Great Bear. He overawed the natives of one island by his ability to predict a lunar eclipse, and drew with some success on astrological lore to predict the weather -- taking his ships to shelter, for example, in the port of Santo Domingo because an aspect between Jupiter and Mercury seemed to portend a tropical storm. Yet Columbus could not proceed solely by the sky. Knowledge of celestial navigation in Europe was wanting, and so, for the most part, he relied on a magnetic compass to measure his course or direction, and on his own method of "dead" or deduced reckoning to estimate his position on the main.</p><p>But it was the stars that led him on. Columbus understood that the world was a globe and believed that by sailing directly west he would eventually reach the shores of Asia (or the "Indies"). He could not know, of course, that America intervened. But it was not the fabled wealth of the Indies that held him most in thrall. For the voyage itself was spurred on by an astrological idea. That idea was the "great conjunction" theory of history, as first set forth in the writings of the Persians, elaborated by the Arabs, and adopted by the Latin West. Columbus had encountered it in the work of the French cardinal, theologian, and astrologer Pierre d'Ailly.</p><p>According to this theory, important historical events such as the rise and fall of empires, the birth of religions, and cultural transformations were marked by the "great planetary conjunctions" of Jupiter and Saturn as they revolved through their cycles in the sky. Such great conjunctions occurred once every 960 years -- a principal source of our idea of the millennium -- as the planets completed a circuit of the zodiac, combining and recombining in the signs. In the course of that round, the two conjoined -- that is, occupied the same degree of celestial longitude -- forty-eight times. For d'Ailly, human history was explained by the unfolding impact of these conjunctions, according to their scale. Shifts between triplicities or elements (earth, air, fire, and water, by which the signs of the zodiac were grouped) were associated with dynastic change; the greater or near-millennial conjunctions were linked to epochal change as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes and overwhelming floods. In d'Ailly's view, such great conjunctions had heralded or coincided with the Great Flood, the fall of Troy, the death of Moses, the foundation of Rome, and the advent of Christ. "All astronomers are agreed in this," he declared, "that there never was one of those conjunctions without some great and notable change in this world."</p><p>D'Ailly's work had convinced Columbus that the end of the world was near, and that it would be accompanied by the conversion of all heathenkind to Christ. For that reason, he called himself Christophorus (or "Christo-ferens," as he came to sign his name), "the Christ-bearer," and conceived himself the agent of God's work as the world approached its final days. All this he explained in a letter to his royal patrons, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. He wrote of the Indies: "These vast realms are peopled with immortal souls, for whose redemption Christ, the Son of God, has made an atoning sacrifice. It is the mission which God has assigned to me to search them out, and to carry to them the Gospel of Salvation." He took as his text Isaiah 11:10-12 -- "The Lord shall...recover the remnant of his people...and gather together the dispersed...from the four corners of the earth" -- and his historic first voyage itself seemed emblematic of that charge.</p><p>On the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus set sail with three small ships -- the <i>Niï¿½a</i>, the <i>Pinta</i>, and the <i>Santa Marï¿½a</i> -- from Palos, Spain, and steered for the Canary Islands, where he reprovisioned before striking due west. After a difficult voyage of two months with a near-mutinous crew, on October 12 he at length sighted land. At two o'clock in the morning, a gun was fired to give the signal. All three vessels then took in their sails and laid to, "waiting impatiently for the dawn." Upon making landfall, "the voice of prayer and the melody of praise rose from his ships," and his own first action was to prostrate himself upon the ground. To Columbus, his journey's end was heaven-sent. For their part, the natives on the small Bahamian island were not wholly mistaken, perhaps, when they cried out at dawn to their brethren, "Come see the people from the sky."</p><p>Columbus would later say that he owed all he had achieved to the grace of God and "God-given" arts of astrology, geometry, navigation, and arithmetic.</p><p>His own heavily annotated copy of d'Ailly's work, <i>Treatise on the Image of the World</i>, may still be seen in the Columbine Library at Seville.</p><p>***</p><p>According to an ancient tradition, common to both Gnostic and Syriac Christians as well as to the Persians and Jews, Adam received the doctrines and mysteries of astrology directly from the Creator, and by knowledgeably scanning the constellations in the skies foretold that the world would one day be destroyed by water, then by fire. As a memorial to those who came after him, he (or his descendants, Seth and Enoch) had this knowledge engraved upon two pillars, one of brick, the other of stone. According to Flavius Josephus, the Jewish historian and near contemporary of Christ, the second pillar could still be seen in Syria in a.d. 63.</p><p>Astrology is the oldest of the occult sciences. It is also the origin of science itself. From astrology are derived astronomy, calculation of time, mathematics, medicine, botany, mineralogy, and (by way of alchemy) modern chemistry, among other disciplines. Logarithms were originally devised to simplify the calculations necessary in casting horoscopes; the ray theory of vision -- the foundation of modern optics -- developed from astrological theories of the effect of stellar rays on the soul. For five thousand years, from ancient Sumeria and Babylonia to the present day, the stars have been viewed as shaping, by divine power, the course and destiny of human affairs. Indeed, according to the <i>New Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, the earliest symbol of deity known to us -- the cuneiform sign for "god" -- was a star (*).</p><p>Astrological terms permeate our language: <i>conjunction, opposition, forecast, aspect, lunatic, venereal, disaster, influence</i> -- as in <i>influenza</i>, since all epidemics were once ascribed to celestial effects; we speak of "mercurial," "saturnine," or "jovial" temperaments; and people thank their "lucky stars," or consider a person "ill-starred" if his luck is bad. The Hebrew word <i>mazzal</i> means "sign" or constellation; so "Mazzal tov" (the colloquial "Congratulations!") really means, "May you have good stars!" The term <i>fall</i> is astrological, for the fall or autumn equinox marks the descendant of the zodiac year; and <i>revolution</i> is taken from an astrological calculation called a "solar return." The star-shaped halo that once encompassed the Roman emperor's posthumous image -- according to the belief that he ascended to heaven as a star -- was later transformed into the halo of the Christian saint. The pharmaceutical symbol Rx -- commonly said to be an abbreviation for the Latin verb <i>recipere</i> (from which we get <i>recipe</i> or compound) -- is derived from the ancient symbol for the Roman god Jupiter, based on the "Eye" of Horus, an Egyptian god with magical healing powers.</p><p>***</p><p>Astronomy studies the heavenly bodies in order to formulate the natural laws that govern them and to understand how the physical structure of the universe evolved; astrology describes the influence of those bodies upon human character and life. Or, as Ralph Waldo Emerson reputedly remarked, "Astrology is astronomy brought down to earth and applied to the affairs of men." It is an applied science, insofar as it is based on astronomy; an exact science, insofar as its judgments are based on mathematical calculations; and an empirical science, insofar as its deductions are based on data gathered over the course of time.</p><p>Its method is a horoscope, which is a map or diagram of the heavens cast for a particular moment of time, and read according to well-established rules. Those rules, if properly applied, are free from the elements of chance or divination; moreover, they are substantially based on a written tradition that derives its authority not just from dogma and belief, but from thousands of years of observation. The idea at the heart of astrology is that the pattern of a person's life -- or character, or nature -- corresponds to the planetary pattern at the moment of his birth. Such an idea is as old as the world is old -- that all things bear the imprint of the moment they are born.</p><p>Whether this is true or not may be subject to debate. But the belief that it is has proved to have enduring power.</p><p>Astrology in modern times has undergone a remarkable resurgence, and is now (as Carl Jung predicted it would) knocking again at the doors of academe. Astrologers are attempting to verify traditional doctrine by scientific methods and in general to meet the demand of Johannes Kepler (...</p></p><h2>Marshall Armstrong is New to Our School</h2><p>Quirky, witty and brilliant, Marshall Armstrong is new to school and he definitely stands out from the crowd; but will he find it easy to make friends?

He lives in New York City.Chapter 1 A Few Years Back, Late Spring<br><br>The great revelations of my adult life began with the shouts of a lost soul in my neighborhood breakfast joint.<br><br>I was standing in line at the Corner Bakery on State and Cedar, half a block down the street from my pretty brick townhouse, waiting to order a Swiss Oatmeal (muesli) or a Berry Parfait (granola), anyhow something modest. The loudest noises in the place were the tapping of laptop keys and the rustle of someone turning newspaper pages. Abruptly, with a manic indignation that seemed to come from nowhere, the man at the head of the line started uttering the word obstreperous. He started out at a level just above ordinary conversation. By the time he found his rhythm, he was about twice that volume and getting louder as he rolled along. If you had to settle on one word to yell over and over in public, wouldn&#x2019;t you pick something less cumbersome? Yet he kept at it, spinning those four lumpy syllables every possible way, as if trying them on for size. His motive, for nothing actually comes from nowhere, soon became obvious.<br><br>Obstreperous? ObSTREPerous? OBSTREPEROUS? Ob-strep?-ER-ous? OBstreperous?<br><br>Lady, you think I&#x2019;m obstreperous now? This is what he was saying. Give me another thirty seconds, you&#x2019;ll learn all about obstreperous.<br><br>With each repetition, his question grew more heated. The momentarily dumbfounded young woman at the order counter had offended him, he wished her to know how greatly. The guy also thought he was making himself look smart, even witty, but to everyone else in the shop he had uncorked raving lunacy.<br><br>His variations were becoming more imaginative.<br><br>Obstreeperous? Obstraperous? ObstrapOROUS?<br><br>To inspect this dude, I tilted sideways and looked down the good- sized line. I almost wished I hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Right away, it was obvious that the guy was not simply playing around. The next man in line was giving him six feet of empty floor space. Under the best of circumstances, people were going to keep their distance from this character. Eight or nine inches of white- gray hair surged out in stiff waves around his head. He was wearing a torn, slept-in checked suit that might have been ripped off a cornfield scarecrow. Through a latticework of scabs, smears, and bruises, his swollen feet shone a glaring, bloodless white. Like me, he had papers under his elbow, but the wad of newsprint he was clamping to his side appeared to have lasted him at least four or five days. The puffed-up bare feet, scuffed and abraded like shoes, were the worst part.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir?&#x201d; said the woman at the order counter. &#x201c;Sir, you need to leave my store. Step away from the counter, sir, please. You need to step away.&#x201d;<br><br>Two huge kids in Southern Illinois sweatshirts, recent graduates by the look of them, jammed their chairs back and marched straight toward the action. This is Chicago, after all, where big, athletic- looking dudes sprout out of the sidewalks like dandelions on a suburban lawn. Without speaking to anyone, they came up on the homeless guy&#x2019;s flanks, hoisted him by his elbows, and transported him outside. If he had gone limp, they would have had a little trouble, but he was rigid with panic and gave them no more difficulty than would a cigar store Indian. He went stiff as a marble statue. When he went by, I took in his blubbery lips and brown, broken teeth. His bloodshot eyes had a glazed look. The man kept saying, obstreperous obstreperous obstreperous, but the word had become meaningless to him. He was using it for protection, like a totem, and he thought as long as he kept saying it, he was out of danger.<br><br>When I looked into those flat, unseeing eyes, an utterly unforeseen thought jolted me. The impact felt like a blow, and brought with it a cryptic sense of illumination as brief as the flaring of a match.<br><br>I knew someone like that. This terrified man with a one-word vocabulary reminded me so vividly of someone that he might have been that person, now in the act of being ejected onto Rush Street. But . . . who in the world could it have been? No one I knew was anything like the damaged character now staggering forward and back on the sidewalk beyond the great windows, still whispering his totemic word.<br><br>A voice only I could hear said, No one? Think again, Lee. Deep in my chest, something big and decisive&#x2014;something I had been ignoring and thrusting out of view literally for decades&#x2014;stirred in its sleep and twitched its leathery wings. Whatever had nearly awakened tasted, in part, like shame, but shame was by no means all of it.<br><br>Although my first response was to turn away from whatever was causing my internal tumult (and turn away I did, with as much of my native resolve as I could summon), the memory of having witnessed an inexplicable illumination clung to me like a cat that had jumped onto my back and stuck its claws into my skin.<br><br>The next thing I did involved a typical bit of unconscious misdirection&#x2014;I tried to believe that my distress was caused by the register girl&#x2019;s stupid language. Maybe that sounds snobbish, and maybe it is snobbish, but I&#x2019;ve written eight novels, and I pay attention to the way people use words. Maybe too much attention. So when I finally stood in front of the young woman who had told that ruined creature that he &#x201c;needed&#x201d; to leave her &#x201c;store,&#x201d; I expressed my unhappiness by ordering an Anaheim Scrambler, which comes with smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, and a lot of other stuff including hash browns, and a corn muffin, too. (Alas, I am one of those people who tend to use food as a way of dodging unwelcome emotions.) Anyhow, when did people start framing commands in terms of neediness? And how long had people in the restaurant business been calling their establishments &#x201c;stores&#x201d;? Couldn&#x2019;t people see the ugliness and inaccuracy of this crap? The creature within me rolled back into its uneasy sleep, temporarily lulled.<br><br>I parked myself at an empty table, snapped open my paper&#x2014;the Guardian Review&#x2014;and avoided looking at the big front windows until I heard one of the staff bringing my tray to me. For some reason, I turned around and glanced through the window, but of course that wretched, half- sane character had fled. Why did I care what had happened to him, anyhow? I didn&#x2019;t, apart from feeling a sort of generic pity for his suffering. And that poor devil did not remind me of anyone I knew or had once known. For a couple of seconds, a kind of misguided dï¿½jï¿½ vu had come into play. Nobody thought of dï¿½jï¿½ vu as anything except a momentary delusion. It gave you an odd buzz of recognition that felt like occult knowledge, but the buzz was psychic flotsam, of no value whatsoever.<br><br>Forty-five minutes later, I was walking back to my house, hoping that the day&#x2019;s work would go well. The minor disturbance in the Corner Bakery hardly counted even as a memory anymore, except for the moment when I was sliding my key into the front-door lock and saw once again his glassy, bloodshot eyes and heard him whispering obstreperous obstreperous. &#x201c;I need you to stop doing that,&#x201d; I said out loud, and tried to smile as I stepped into my bright, comfortable foyer. Then I said, &#x201c;No, I do not know anyone even faintly like you.&#x201d; For half a second, I thought someone was going to ask me what I was talking about, but my wife was on an extended visit to Washington, D.C., and in the whole of my splendid house, not a single living thing could hear me.<br><br>Work, unfortunately, was of no use at all. I had been planning to use the days my wife was gone to get a jump-start on a new novel then known as Her Level Gaze. Never mind the total lameness of the title, which I intended to change as soon as I came up with a better one. Atop my oversized desk, a folder bulging with notes, outlines, and ideas for chapters sat beside my iMac, and a much smaller folder beside it held the ten awkward pages I had<br><br>managed so far to excrete. Once I started poking it, the novel that had seemed so promising when still a shimmer of possibility had turned into a slow-moving, snarling animal. The male protagonist seemed to be a bit slow-moving, too. Although I did not want to admit it, the main character, the young woman with the disconcertingly level gaze, would have eaten him for breakfast in a single bite.<br><br>At the back of my mind was a matter I did not actually want to think about that day, a far too tempting suggestion made some years ago, God, maybe as many as five, by David Garson, my agent, who told me that my publisher had, who knows how seriously, proposed to him over lunch that at least once I should write a nonfiction book, not merely a memoir, but a book about something.<br><br>&#x201c;Lee,&#x201d; David said, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t get paranoid on me, he wasn&#x2019;t saying he wanted you to stop writing novels, of course he wasn&#x2019;t. They think you have an interesting way of seeing things, that&#x2019;s their main point here, and they think it might be useful if just once, and I mean just once, Lee Harwell could turn this reader-friendly yet challenging trait of his onto some event in the real world. The event could be huge, or it might be something smaller and more personal. He added that he thought a book like that would probably do you some good in the marketplace. He has a point there, actually. I mean, I think it&#x2019;s an extraordinarily interesting idea. Do you want to consider it? Why don&#x2019;t you just mull it over for a couple of days, see what occurs to you? I mean, just as a suggestion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;David,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;no matter what my intentions are, everything I write winds up turning into fiction, including my letters to friends.&#x201d; Yet David is a good guy, and he does look out for me. I promised to think about it, which was disingenuous of me because in fact I already had been turning over the possibility of doing a nonfiction book. An unpublished and unpublishable manuscript I had come across on eBay a couple of months earlier, a kind of memoir by a Milwaukee homicide detective named George Cooper, seemed to crack open an old, officially unsolved series of murders that had much interested my friends and me when we were in grade school and high school. Of even greater interest to me right now was that these &#x201c;Ladykiller&#x201d; homicides appeared to have an at least tangential connection to a dark matter that involved these friends of mine, including the amazing girl who became my wife, though not me, in our last year in high school. But of that I did not wish to think&#x2014;it involved a young man named Keith Hayward who had been, it seemed, a sick, evil child tutored in his sickness and evil by a truly demonic figure, his uncle. All of that was in the sort-of memoir Detective Cooper had written out in his cursive, old-school hand, and even as I put the story together I was determined to resist the gravitational pull it worked on me. The immense theological question of evil felt too great, too complex to address with the tools and weapons I possessed. What I knew best had only to do with stories and how they proceeded, and a mere instinct for narrative wasn&#x2019;t enough to take on the depths of the Hayward story. That my wife and our friends had come in contact with creepy Keith Hayward also put me off.<br><br>At the usual hour of one-thirty, hunger pulled me into the kitchen, where I put together a salad, warmed up some soup, and made half a sandwich with pumpernickel bread, Black Forest ham, coleslaw, and Russian dressing. Dinah Lion, my assistant, who would otherwise have been present, did not come in on Mondays, so the isolation of morning remained intact. Dinah would be gone for the next 10 days or so, also, in an arrangement we had worked out with my accountants that was going to let her join her parents in Tuscany at half pay in exchange for some juggling with the vacation she normally took in August.<br><br>For some reason, the second I sat down before my solitary little meal, I felt like weeping. Something vital was slipping away from me, and for once this sense wasn&#x2019;t just a fantasy about the novel I was writing. The huge wave of sadness building up within me was connected to something more critical than Her Level Gaze; it was something I had lived with for much longer than I had my foundering book. Tears steamed up into my eyes and trembled there. For an excruciating moment, I was in the ridiculous position of grieving for a person, a place, or a condition that remained hidden from me. Someone I loved had died when we were both very young&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what it felt like&#x2014;and I had committed the dim-witted crime of never stopping to mourn that loss until just now. This must have been the source of the shame I tasted before I started ramming scrambled eggs, avocado, and cheddar cheese into my mouth. I had let this person disappear.<br><br>At the thought of the breakfast I had forced down my throat in the Corner Bakery, my hunger curdled. The food on the table looked poisoned. Tears slid down my face, and I stood up to turn toward the counter and grab some tissues. After I had wiped my face and blown my nose, I bagged up the half sandwich, covered the salad bowl with clingy film, and slammed the soup bowl into the microwave, where I could be counted on to forget about it until the next time I opened the thing. Then I made an aimless circuit of the kitchen. The book I had begun writing seemed to have locked me out, which I usually take to mean that it&#x2019;s waiting for some other, younger author to come along and treat it right. It would be at least a day before I could face my desk again, and when I did I would probably have to dream up some other project.</p><h2>Gordon Bunshaft and SOM: Building Corporate Modernism</h2><p><b>A nuanced portrait of the 20th-century architect whose work defined the built aesthetic of corporate America</b><br><br> Gordon Bunshaft&#x2019;s (1909&#x2013;1990) landmark 1952 design for Lever House reshaped the Manhattan skyline and elevated the reputation of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), the firm where he would spend more than 40 years as a partner. Although this enigmatic architect left behind few records, his legacy endures in the corporate headquarters, museums, and libraries that were built in his distinctive modernist style. Bunshaft&#x2019;s career was marked by shifts in material. Glass and steel structures of the 1950s, such as New York&#x2019;s Chase Manhattan Bank, gave way to revolutionary designs in concrete, such as the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University and the doughnut-shaped Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC.&nbsp;Bunshaft&#x2019;s collaborations with artists, including Isamu Noguchi, Jean Dubuffet, and Henry Moore, were of paramount importance throughout his career.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nicholas Adams explores the contested line between Bunshaft&#x2019;s ambition for acclaim as a singular artistic genius and the collaborative structure of SOM&#x2019;s architectural partnership. Bunshaft received the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1988 and remains the only SOM partner to have achieved this distinction. Adams counters Bunshaft&#x2019;s maxim that &#x201c;the building speaks for itself&#x201d; with necessary critical context about this modernist moment at a time when the future of Bunshaft&#x2019;s iconic works is very much in question.</p><p>This nuanced portrait of Gordon Bunshaft and his work for the architecture firm SOM explores his role in defining the built aesthetic of corporate America.<b>Nicholas Adams</b> is professor emeritus of architectural history at Vassar College.</p><h2>They Said: A Multi-Genre Anthology of Contemporary Collaborative Writing</h2><p>Poetry.

Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008.

Despite Thirrin's bravery and the support of Oskan, the Witch's son, the task proves more difficult than Thirrin ever dreamed. She must assemble a force to rival her opponent. And, in the chill winter of Icemark, she only has until spring to unite the strange beasts and frightening creatures who live just outside her country. Ultimately, it is Thirrin's vision and determination that will see her through to victory.</p><p>Stuart Hill was born in Leicester, in the East Midlands, where he still lives. He has worked as a car trimmer, a cemetery gardener, a teacher, archaeologist and bookseller. He now writes full-time. The Cry of the Icemark is his first novel for children.Grade 5-8&#x2013;This epic fantasy has at its center a spunky 13-year-old warrior princess. When her father dies in a heroic battle with a gigantic invading army, Thirrin becomes queen of her small but hardy country, the Icemark. Having already made allies of the werewolves and found a friend and advisor in a young warlock, Oskan, she sets off with him to forge new alliances. They journey to the land of the Vampire King and Queen and persuade them to join the alliance, and then go on to the dangerous talking snow leopards, the leader of whom becomes a most valuable friend. The final third of the book deals with the extended siege of the capital city and the bloody battles in and around it, leading to the eventual defeat of the invaders. Characters tend to be two-dimensional and conflicts within and between them do little to influence the plot. Thirrin's shyness in personal encounters, for example, quickly disappears. Oskan goes through experiences that should be transformative, especially in a young person, but he shows no evidence of inner change throughout the book. In general, the writing tends to be explanatory rather than descriptive, and this leads to a flatness in what should be an exciting story. Nancy Farmer's <i>The Sea of Trolls</i> (S &amp; S, 2004) tackles a similar northern setting with far more realism and suspense. While lovers of Christopher Paolini's <i>Eragon</i> (Knopf, 2003) may take to this novel, and its courageous female protagonist is laudable, in the presently crowded field of fantasies, it will struggle to stand out.<i>&#x2013;Sue Giffard, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Somewhere between Melbourne and Sydney, and nestled between the pristine Sapphire Coast and the imposing Mount Gulaga, lies the beautiful old dairy farm which is now the home of River Cottage Australia, and 'new Hugh' Paul West.</p><p>Paul is a fresh, exciting face on the global food scene, as well as a brilliant presenter. Predictably, there is a healthy dose of competition between Hugh and Paul. They have fought over who can catch the first octopus and have raced to find the first mushroom of the year. But they have similar passions--sustainability and environmental issues being at the forefront--and on the farm they discover fantastic bounty as they forage for food and share the products of their culinary skills with the locals.</p><p>Featuring recipes from the first three series of <i>River Cottage Australia</i>, this is the cookbook that will reveal the delicious dishes which Paul has been creating on the farm. The book is divided into seven chapters and includes more than 120 recipes such as pumpkin scones, roasted octopus salad, baked salmon, spiced aubergine salad, pig on a spit, borlotti bean broth, raw courgette salad and warm curb cake with honey rhubarb. With a preface by Hugh (and a sprinkling of his recipes throughout), plus atmospheric, beautiful photography by Mark Chew, this is one of the best cookbooks of the year.</p></p><p><p>Born in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, <b>Paul West </b>trained as chef at Melbourne's renowned Vue de Monde.

The region conjures up strong images to all of us, and nowhere has its extraordinary social and political history been so fully expressed than through these carefully selected texts and images that capture the Southern love of language, sense of place, and often tragic experiences.<br>We share the vision and passion of the unique heritage of the South through the powerful voices of favorite writers from Thomas Jefferson, Margaret Mitchell, and Mark Twain, to William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Martin Luther King, Jr., Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, and Alex Haley. Visual artists capture the haunting environment in colorful, expressive drawings, etchings, watercolor and oil paintings, as well as remarkable folk art and stunning handicrafts.<br>The illustrations in this magnificent collection range from Mississippian-period carved figures from the Etowah Mounds, Georgia, to a sixteenth-century map of Virginia and drawings of the Indian Village of Secoton, to historical portraits including John Trumbull's painting of George Washington and George Catlin's famous drawings of native Americans, to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scenes of plantation and town life, as well as haunting Civil War images. Depression-era photographs by Walker Evans and Marion Post Wolcott are included as are images by contemporary Southern photographers like William Eggleston and Sally Mann.<br>Garcilaso de la Vega, Captain John Smith, and Mark Catesby capture the newcomers' enchantment with the lush opulence of the natural landscape. Selections from letters, diaries, and memoirs reveal the problems and promise inherent in the founding of a new society during the eighteenth century. Graphic depictions of a suppressed culture revealed through slave narratives foreshadow the cataclysm of the Civil War. The accounts of both soldiers and civilians and Robert E. Lee's farewell address to his troops are eloquent testimonies to that war's great costs.<br>The distinctly Southern experience is perhaps nowhere more apparent than in the works of its native sons and daughters; their voices and visions come to life in a rich, wide-ranging selection of texts and images describing Mardi Gras, a fourth of July barbecue, an evening of blues, or the Kentucky Derby. From local color writers like Kate Chopin, Joel Chandler Harris, and Mark Twain to the novelists, short-story writers, musicians, playwrights, and poets whose work both reflected and revitalized Southern culture during the first half of the twentieth century - William Alexander Percy, Thomas Wolfe, W. C. Handy, Richard Wright, Allen Tate, Robert Penn Warren and others - to contemporary writers like Walker Percy, Barry Hannah, Alice Walker, Shelby Foote, and Florence King, Southern writers have delighted the imagination and captured the human condition.<br>The richness and diversity of centuries of Southern life and art are celebrated in more than two hundred carefully selected illustrations that complement the text and provide a fascinating gallery of images. Also included are the voices and images of the South as experienced by visitors to this remarkable region that has inspired so much creativity.</p><p>In her introduction to this attractive album, Howorth, who teaches Southern culture at the University of Mississippi, observes that there are many Souths: gracious living and literary sophistication have coexisted with violence, prejudice and illiteracy. Juxtaposing letters, memoirs, essays, stories, eyewitness accounts, song lyrics and poems with paintings, sculpture, etchings and folk art, this volume provides a revealing window on Southern life and art in all its diversity. "Outsiders" such as Alexis de Toqueville and Bostonian Henry Adams take a wickedly incisive look at the Old South while the convulsions of the modern South and the 20th-century efflorescence of Southern writing are reflected in selections by Richard Wright, Wendell Berry, Alice Walker, Harry Crews, Barry Hannah and others. Also featured in this panorama are Romare Bearden's paintings, Harriet Powers's narrative quilts, Walker Evans's photographs and writings by Rosa Parks, Truman Capote, W. C. Handy and Jean Toomer. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.This richly illustrated volume is published in connection with the University of Mississippi's Center for the Study of Southern Culture and has a brief but cogent introduction by Howorth, who works at the center. Illustrated with both black-and-white and color reproductions of Southern art, from 18th-century oils to mixed-media works by Robert Rauschenberg, it is nonetheless more than a coffee-table extravaganza. In fact, the illustrations are beautifully arranged to coincide with an extensive, chronologically organized array of prose writing by Southerners, from William Byrd to William Styron. This handsome volume offers both a history of the region and an attempt to define honestly the Southern character. For both lay readers and scholars.<br><i>- Charles C.

Recently, he turned his creative energies toward comics, penning both original stories and adaptations, including <i>Raiju</i> and <i>Raiden</i> with Loï¿½c Sï¿½cheresse and an adaptation of <i>The Great Gatsby</i> with Benjamin Bachelier.<br> &nbsp;<br> CLï¿½MENT OUBRERIE is the acclaimed illustrator of more than forty picture books and is a co-founder of the 3D animation studio Station OMD. His comics include the Aya of Yopougon series by Marguerite Abouet and <i>Pablo</i> by Julie Birmant. His illustrations for <i>The Golden Compass</i> won an award at the International Comics Festival in Angoulï¿½me, France.Gr 6 Up&#x2014;This exciting second volume of Pullman's saga lives up to the promise of the first. Lyra and the Gyptians are continuing their northward quest, but first Lyra must recruit a new companion, the ferocious panserbjï¿½rn Iorek Byrnison. The party, including the aeronaut Texan Lee Scoresby, are attacked by Samoyed hunters, who apprehend Lyra and take her to Bolvangar. The Gobblers pretend to be caring for the children they have captured, but in fact they perform experiments to remove the connection between the children and their daemons. This volume ends with Lyra leading the escape of the children and the battle between the Gobbler forces and Lyra's allies, with airborne witches providing much-needed support. As in the first volume, Oubrerie employs muted colors, with notable exceptions (his brilliant blues and greens for the Aurora). His accessible style recalls a young person's doodling, albeit with greater detail.

Many terms are used to describe this phenomenon. Giftedness, talents, motivated abilities, natural strengths, motivational patterns or passion and purpose are some of the most common. Regardless of the specific term used, all are intended to convey the fact that every time a person accomplishes something personally significant and enjoyable, he or she will inevitably repeat some or all of the aspects of his or her innate motivation. Over time, a consistent pattern emerges that, if recognized and understood, reveals the basis for fulfillment and productivity for that individual. This book presents the System of Identifying Motivated Abilities, (SIMA), a behavior-based assessment process designed to identify this unique but consistent pattern of your natural strengths. <p>The outcome of this SIMA Assessment is a description of your vocationally sighnificant motivations--what you enjoy doing and feel you did well. </p><p>It describes: </p><p>- the "motivated" abilities that recur in your work/life achievements </p><p>- the subject matter or content with which you are motivated to work </p><p>the circumstances that trigger and sustain yur efforts </p><p>the way in which you prefer to relate to others when you are working </p><p>- the overall outcome or payoff that you seek to achieve from your efforts. </p><p>This set of information, which is your Motivational Pattern, should be the foundation of every decision you make about your job, your career and even your life.After you have identified your Motivational Pattern, you may elect to have your pattern compared to profiles of more than 400 professions and occupations to determine the "best fit" for you.</p></p><p>How many people do you know who love their work? <p>Look at the people around you. Look up, down and sideways. Look at people you work with in other departments and divisions, and those employed by your suppliers and customers. Recall your history with colleagues, bosses and subordinates. How many would you suspect are, or were, a mismatch in the job they occupied? One out of 10--one out of five--three? How about one out of two...at the minimum? </p><p>A recent Career Education Corporation survey reported that half of the employed auults in the United States would con- sider changing their career and nearly 25 percent planned to do so in the next year. </p><p>It's like a secret that everybody knows but nobody talks about! How many bosses have you had who made good use of your talents? How many real leaders have you served under? How often have you occupied a job that fit you like undersized shoes? Of all those who have tried to sell you, mentor you, serve you, correct you, counsel you, train you, preach to you, or fix your car, how many were "fitted" to their job? </p><p>In their work with people who were doing what they loved to do, the authors of PASSION AND PURPOSE found a consistent pattern of strengths driven by a particular motivation to accomplish a certain outcome. The fundamental nature of this pattern never changes: The key to productive use of any person is to tap into her pattern of innate strengths, unqiue power and passiom. Why, then, does job mismatch plague so many? Because neither employees nor managers recognize the existence or the power of these patterns of innate motivations, nor do they fully comprehend the impact these patterns have on both performance and fulfillment. </p><p>The result? People lose their way. The majority occupy positions for which they do not possess both the desire and the ability to perform - resulting in mismatch of crippling proportions. </p><p>PASSION AND PURPOSE offers new and promising help. It is based on assessments of more than 50,000 individuals - and the organization's use of those assessments to leverage talents to meet both individual goals and organizational needs. It is offers unique career insights that are significantly more accurate and predictive than those found in the many career books now on the shelf.</p>"Successful" people in every walk of life have one thing in common: they follow their passion. Like most successful people, the individuals on the cover of this book were not born successful, but they each leveraged their unique passion to achieve their purpose--and found success in their efforts. <p>Passion frequently appears in early childhood, but for many, their passion emerges in their teens. And for some of us, our actual calling or career requires more time in order to manifest itself. The potential may be present, but it is not always clear just how that potential should be nurtured. </p><p>But everyone, not just "successful" people, has a story to be told. By reflecting on your story, you will begin to understand why you remember (in great detail) certain events in your life--yet can hardly recall others. You will begin to recognise the unique and powerful themes in your life/work activities. You will identify--and thus be more prepared to successfully leverage--your passion and purpose.</p></p><h2>The Herb Garden: A Complete Guide to Growing Scented, Culinary and Medicinal Herbs</h2><p>Beautiful, fragrant, and magical, yet functional as well, herbs should grace every garden.

No surprise, then, that this book is a feast for the eyes--but it's remarkable even by their exalted standards. The text, printed in large, clear capitals along the bottom of the pages, consists simply of the famous verses from Ecclesiastes: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die...." Each phrase is illustrated by one of 16 panels, and each panel stems from the artistic style of a different culture, from Egyptian tomb friezes, to Japanese harvest scenes, to Aboriginal bark paintings, to Greek vase paintings. The rich, sophisticated illustrations may appeal more to parents than to their children--and verses like "a time to kill" may be too much for the very young--but there could be no more beautiful vehicle for the old wisdom that we have to know, expect, and live with both the good and the bad that life will inevitably bring us. At the end of the book the authors provide interesting information on the style and the art history behind each illustration. (Click to see a sample spread.

Her articles and short stories have appeared in <i>Vogue, Rolling Stone, Esquire </i>and<i> The New York Times Book Review. </i>Her books include <i>Eve&#x2019;s Hollywood, Slow Days, Fast Company, Two by Two, </i>and <i>Sex and Rage.</i>L.A.WOMAN <br>ONE SUMMER MORNING while I was still a virgin though my virginity was on its last legs, I woke up and didn&#x2019;t want to go to New Jersey. It wasn&#x2019;t fair that they wanted me to go to New Jersey; I didn&#x2019;t want to go&#x2014;I was seventeen and no seventeen-year-old L.A. woman would go to New Jersey if she could get out of it, especially a seventeen-year-old with a boyfriend like mine&#x2014;a dream-boat who was twenty-five, was under contract to Fox as a leading man, black wavy hair and blue eyes, his father a French leading man who&#x2019;d once starred in a tearjerker with my Great Aunt Golda and made a million dollars which he lost on a misadventure. Anybody who went to New Jersey just to visit Aunt Helen, I supposed with outraged sensibilities, would have to be nuts. Aunt Helen was nuts to have moved to New Jersey at all, and she was really insane inviting decent L.A. people to visit her on the fucking East Coast.<br> <br>But my father and mother kept up their demand, even if I did remain in L.A., about the people they would allow me to remain with. I refused hands down. Not my grandmother, period&#x2014;I mean, staying with my grandmother would be like not being in L.A. at all. My Aunt Goldie&#x2019;s place was big enough but my cousin Ophelia had been such a drag in those days and gone to such lengths to antagonize her new stepfather by leaving joints around in 1960 where he could see them that he&#x2019;d become embittered against the entire younger generation of Lubins before my sister Bonnie or I even had a chance to try our hand. I wouldn&#x2019;t stay with the people across the street who&#x2019;d been there while I was growing up and whose daughter Shelly Craven was my age and with whom we have everything outwardly in common, because for one thing we didn&#x2019;t forgive them&#x2014;they were Stalinists and a line of blood was painted right down the middle of Foothill Drive once they moved in when I was six&#x2014;and besides, they weren&#x2019;t home, they were in Rome. Not that I myself wouldn&#x2019;t have forgiven them for being Stalinists&#x2014;what I didn&#x2019;t forgive them for was playing Pablo Casals on the record player and having that melodrama going on in the middle of the afternoon as Molly Craven&#x2019;s token of cultural refinement. And none of my friends, like Franny Blossom, were people whose families my family would put up with&#x2014;although Franny&#x2019;s house, God knows, was a rambling mansion and the whole guest wing was empty since Franny&#x2019;s &#x201c;uncle&#x201d;&#x2014;who wasn&#x2019;t really an uncle but who drank as much as her father and mother and thus was a dear family friend&#x2014;had gone down to Rosarito Beach fishing for three months. But ever since Franny&#x2019;s father had taken a beebee gun out and begun shooting it at a brass Liberty Bell above the fireplace on the mantel, my mother declared they were &#x201c;trash&#x201d; and once she said that, spending even one night was asking for the moon. So it looked like I was going to New Jersey and going to have to spend an entire month on the fucking East Coast.<br> <br>But I knew I wasn&#x2019;t even though the next morning was when the plane was leaving. I knew something would save me.<br> <br>I never would have imagined it would be Lola. Even though once before she slept on our living room couch when she and Luther had a fight and she drove straight down from San Francisco in six hours like a demon, back in the days when it took eight hours for any sane person to drive down.<br> <br>Yet the moment I saw that intensely dark red hair I knew it was Lola.<br> <br>Lola had come.<br> <br>And Lola would understand perfectly why a seventeen-year-old virgin going to summer school at Hollywood High would rather not go to the fucking East Coast for a month. Of all my parents&#x2019; friends, Lola was the only one who, even though she was almost beyond her fiftieth birthday, was still L.A. enough to realize that you don&#x2019;t leave anyone with a smile like my new boyfriend Claude&#x2019;s for a whole month and expect him to be there when you got back&#x2014;especially once I showed her his picture, which I happened to have with me when I explained this to her at 6:45 A.M.&#x2014;and especially when I wasn&#x2019;t even fucking him before I left so he&#x2019;d have something to remember me by. Bleaching my hair blond and looking like Sheena, the queen of the jungle, which was how I looked, wasn&#x2019;t enough, tan or no tan. I simply had to stay in L.A. and learn how to go down on him. But I&#x2019;d never learn to go down on anyone if Ophelia didn&#x2019;t tear herself away from the Westlake School of Music and her junkie jazz musicians, which was her idea of fun. And Ophelia promised to tear herself away on Saturday but by Saturday I&#x2019;d be in New Jersey. And it was something she had to explain in person. Every time she began even attempting to explain on the phone, we both cracked our heads on the floor from falling down and wept tears of depraved laughter. But I didn&#x2019;t need to tell Lola about all of that, I knew, all I had to do was beg her. Keep it simple.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; I said, waking Lola up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she agreed, painfully&#x2014;she&#x2019;d gotten to L.A. at 2:00 A.M.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please, Lola,&#x201d; I begged, at 6:47 A.M., &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve got to stay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2014;&#x201d; She laughed. Since she never drank, she never woke up with hangovers and waking up was much easier for her than it was for Franny&#x2019;s parents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stay with me,&#x201d; I said, shooting my picture of Claude smiling straight into my pitch. &#x201c;For a month, Lola. Oh, please. Please! Can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A month, why I&#x2014;&#x201d; Lola said, her mouth dropping open&#x2014;but smiling&#x2014;still insane enough by her fiftieth birthday to think this was a good idea basically. Besides which, she could not resist begging.<br> <br>&#x201c;They want me to go to the fucking East Coast!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;To visit Helen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t want to go,&#x201d; I explained, &#x201c;I want to stay here&#x201d;&#x2014;she looked at Claude&#x2019;s picture, her eyes widening&#x2014;&#x201c;with Claude.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a doll,&#x201d; Lola said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I admitted, &#x201c;it is touched up. The studio didn&#x2019;t like his nose like it was. But otherwise he&#x2019;s really this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lola pulled her reading glasses out of her purse beside the couch and scrutinized Claude&#x2019;s face with more objective detachment. I waited, not breathing. Of course, Claude&#x2019;s black wavy hair from being French wouldn&#x2019;t go against him. They all had black wavy hair back in those days, back when they were dancing and touring with Teretsky, marrying the wrong people. All the wrong people marrying each other had black wavy hair and the absolutely impossible men had the same kind of grin beaming ravenously out of Claude&#x2019;s autographed eight-by-ten glossy. So surely Lola would save me and stay while I perilously endangered my future, wrecked the vacation, and threw away the possibility to travel someplace halfway decent and see a Real City&#x2014;New York&#x2014;finally, which all my life I&#x2019;d been told I had to do. For a bloodthirsty smile like Claude&#x2019;s, combined with how black his wavy hair was, threw the whole fucking East Coast into shadow. For compared with the trouble I could be in in Hollywood over the next month, all the evil companions I might fall in with in New York just paled. In fact that summer, if I&#x2019;d been asked, everything paled by comparison to me then when I thought of going anyplace outside L.A. Just bothering to go someplace other than Santa Monica was incomprehensible when I could just wake up every morning at dawn, yank on my bathing suit still on the floor from the night before when I&#x2019;d yanked it off, hurry down to Hollywood and Gower to catch the 91S bus down Hollywood Boulevard and then Santa Monica Boulevard to Beverly Hills and transfer to the 83 going straight out to the beach untilfinally there I&#x2019;d be, at 8:00 A.M. or so, able to feel the cool sand get warm as the morning sun glazed over the tops of the palm trees up on the palisades while waves of the ocean crashed down day after day so anyone could throw himself into the tides and bodysurf throughout eternity.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your poor mother,&#x201d; Lola sighed, resigned.<br> <br>&#x201c;She said I had no one to stay with,&#x201d; I said, determined. &#x201c;She has to let me. If you&#x2019;re here, she has to.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Lola said, &#x201c;it couldn&#x2019;t hurt Luther to know I can stay away for a month. But you tell your mother. It has to be okay with her, you know? Gee, I never imagined I&#x2019;d be staying here with you a whole month&#x2014;and in the same neighborhood as me when I was growing up. You know, our old house isn&#x2019;t far from here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Lola, thank God you&#x2019;ve come,&#x201d; I cried, although I&#x2019;d known something had to save me&#x2014;of course, I never would have dreamed someone as good as Lola, my parents&#x2019; only halfway-up-to-date friend from the olden days, would be part of the deal.<br> <br>I mean in those days, as far as I was concerned, all the Trotskyites and Stalinists and Republicans and Democrats and anyone else wearing a suit on the cover of Time magazine because of politics could go jump in a lake, and yet somehow, in the very midst of it all, there stood Lola. Picketing. Great legs, a figure which, when I was seventeen, I watched men drive into telephone poles over, a bizarre use of earrings, an altogether Cleopatra-girl slink to every move in her whole body, a demonically objective attitude about sizing things up and speaking her findings with a voice touched with nothing more than a glow of detached amusement over details she&#x2019;d recount, laying to waste listeners, speechless when she told them, &#x201c;Oh, didn&#x2019;t you know, she and her father bathe together. How old do you think she is? Thirty-seven. The mother, you know, she died when the girl was only a child. No one, I guess, wanted to tell him&#x2014;or her&#x2014;I mean bathing! Together. Or am I too old-fashioned?&#x201d;<br> <br>But of course she had never been old-fashioned enough to most of the people my father knew when political criteria were his pride and joy, although oddly enough in the end she was the only one we ever really wanted to see after all. Because old-fashioned she never became.</p><h2>Unexpected Magic: Collected Stories</h2><p><p>What if your strangest dreams and wildest imaginings turned out to be . . . well . . . true? </p><p>In this riveting collection, master storyteller Diana Wynne Jones presents wildly unpredictable tales in which even the most routine lives are visited by extraordinary events:</p><p></p><ul> <li>A writer's character infiltrates her computer and makes her an accomplice in his cyber revolt</li><p></p><p> </p><li>A sick girl's drawings come to life -- with a vengeance</li><p></p><p> </p><li>A vet's dream about a wounded werewolf is interrupted by a startling phone call</li><p></p><p> </p><li>A cat tells how the kindhearted wizard she owns is suddenly called upon to defeat a horrific Beast</li><p></p><p></p></ul><p></p><p>These fifteen stories and one novella -- including three works never before published in the United States -- will tickle and enchant, startle and surprise. </p></p><p><p>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934&#x2012;2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers. Characterized by magic, multiple universes, witches and wizards&#x2014;and a charismatic nine-lived enchanter&#x2014;her books are filled with unlimited imagination, dazzling plots, and an effervescent sense of humor that earned her legendary status in the world of fantasy.</p>Grade 6 Up&#x2013;This collection of 15 short stories and one novella begins with the autobiographical "The Girl Jones," about nine-year-old Diana. Among the selections that follow, readers will find stories about a science-fiction writer who becomes involved in an interstellar revolution, a haunting encounter with werewolves and a sinister fool, and a talking cat cursed with long life. In the concluding novella, four children become embroiled in intrigue over an innocent prince, an evil count, and a brave outlaw. All of the selections have characters that are both appealing and realistically flawed, and the worlds they inhabit are brought to life through detail and humor. Each story smoothly draws readers in and brings its own mood and adventure. This is a good choice for collections in which the author has a following, though the lack of "Chrestomanci" stories and the somewhat daunting size may put off readers. The hefty volume includes most of the selections from <i>Warlock at the Wheel and Other Stories</i> (1985; o.p.) and <i>Believing Is Seeing: Seven Stories</i> (1999). However, the lack of overlap with <i>Stopping for a Spell</i> (2004) and <i>Mixed Magics</i> (2001, all Greenwillow), along with the new tales included, makes this a solid addition.<i>&#x2013;Beth L.

Driven by constant warfare, weakened by betrayal and rivalries, many see the grip of Empress Laseen beginning to weaken as conquered kingdoms and principalities test their old independence. <br><br>Into this gathering civil war on Quon Tali, the Empire&#x2019;s homeland comes the Guard. And with their return comes the memory of their hundred-year-old vow &#x2014; undying opposition to the existence of the Empire. Yet rivalries and betrayals stalk the Guard as well; elements of its elite, the Avowed, scheme to open paths to even greater power, and ancient potent entities, Ascendants, also lend a hand exploiting all sides to further their own arcane ends. Meanwhile, a swordsman, Traveller, and his companion Ereko, move from one strange encounter to another in a mysterious dance meant ultimately to bring the swordsman to a final confrontation from which none has ever returned. <br><br>As the Crimson Guard gathers from around the globe, Empress Laseen faces a more immediate threat from the generals and old commanders of her predecessor, Emperor Kellanved, who have lost patience with what they see as Laseen&#x2019;s mismanagement.

Esslemont was born in Winnipeg. His first novel was the acclaimed <b>Night of Knives</b>.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Starred Review. Nearly 100 years ago, the Crimson Guard vowed they would not die until they destroyed the Malazan Empire. In this riveting sequel to 2009's <i>Night of Knives</i>, the time has come for that vow to be fulfilled. The empire has been stretched too far, too thin. Empress Laseen is boxed up in Unta, the imperial capital, while the conquered and the conquerors clash on the Seti Plains. At last the call comes for the Crimson Guard to re-form and add their undying forces to the melee. In a long, bloody, explosive-filled battle to end all battles, Esslemont handily outdoes series cocreator Steven Erikson, evoking the gore and grit of the battlefield while cannily expanding the labyrinthine Malazan world and untangling the wickedly intertwined stories just enough to keep readers from feeling lost. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a Western man profoundly affected by the mysticism of Eastern thought, he wrote many novels, stories, and essays that bear a vital spiritual force that has captured the imagination and loyalty of many generations of readers. His works include <i>Beneath the Wheel</i>, <i>Narcissus and Goldmund</i>, and <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946. Hermann Hesse died in 1962. <br>Hesse&#39;s philosophical novel about a loner who feels divided in his soul and alienated from life was a cult classic of the 1960s&#39; counterculture. Peter Weller&#39;s voice is dry, deep, almost harsh, and through much of the book, his tone is cutting, sardonic, even angry. That&#39;s a fitting take on the protagonist, Haller, but it&#39;s too much, and the tone would be better with some variation. Weller&#39;s voice softens when Haller interacts with others, and in some of the dialogue he brings out a rhythmic lilt that is quite engaging. While a bit uneven, by and large, Weller does this dreamlike yet dour book justice.

Born in 1965, he read history at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. Author of two novels and presenter of television documentaries, he is married with two children and lives in London.<b>PROLOGUE: The Bank Robbery</b><br><br>At 10:30 a.m. on the sultry morning of Wednesday, 26 June 1907, in the seething central square of Tiflis, a dashing mustachioed cavalry captain in boots and jodhpurs, wielding a big Circassian sabre, performed tricks on horseback, joking with two pretty, well-dressed Georgian girls who twirled gaudy parasols&#x2013;while fingering Mauser pistols hidden in their dresses.<br><br>Raffish young men in bright peasant blouses and wide sailor-style trousers waited on the street corners, cradling secreted revolvers and grenades. At the louche Tilipuchuri Tavern on the square, a crew of heavily armed gangsters took over the cellar bar, gaily inviting passers-by to join them for drinks. All of them were waiting to carry out the first exploit by Josef Djugashvili, aged twenty-nine, later known as Stalin, to win the attention of the world.[1]<br><br>Few outside the gang knew of the plan that day for a criminal terrorist &#x201c;spectacular,&#x201d; but Stalin had worked on it for months. One man who did know the broad plan was Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Party,[2] hiding in a villa in Kuokola, Finland, far to the north. Days earlier, in Berlin, and then in London, Lenin had secretly met with Stalin to order the big heist, even though their Social-Democratic Party had just strictly banned all &#x201c;expropriations,&#x201d; the euphemism for bank robberies. But Stalin&#x2019;s operations, heists and killings, always conducted with meticulous attention to detail and secrecy, had made him the &#x201c;main financier of the Bolshevik Centre.&#x201d;[3]<br><br>The events that day would make headlines all over the globe, literally shake Tiflis to its foundations, and further shatter the fragmented Social-Democrats into warring factions: that day would both make Stalin&#x2019;s career and almost ruin it&#x2013;a watershed in his life.<br><br>In Yerevan Square, the twenty brigands who formed the core of Stalin&#x2019;s gang, known as &#x201c;the Outfit,&#x201d; took up positions as their lookouts peered down Golovinsky Prospect, Tiflis&#x2019;s elegant main street, past the white Italianate splendour of the Viceroy&#x2019;s Palace. They awaited the clatter of a stagecoach and its squadron of galloping Cossacks. The army captain with the Circassian sabre caracoled on his horse before dismounting to stroll the fashionable boulevard.<br><br>Every street corner was guarded by a Cossack or policeman: the authorities were ready. Something had been expected since January. The informers and agents of the Tsar&#x2019;s secret police, the Okhrana, and his uniformed political police, the Gendarmes, delivered copious reports about the clandestine plots and feuds of the gangs of revolutionaries and criminals. In the misty twilight of this underground, the worlds of bandit and terrorist had merged and it was hard to tell tricks from truth. But there had been &#x201c;chatter&#x201d; about a &#x201c;spectacular&#x201d;&#x2013;as today&#x2019;s intelligence experts would put it&#x2013;for months.<br><br>On that dazzling steamy morning, the Oriental colour of Tiflis (now Tbilisi, the capital of the Republic of Georgia) hardly seemed to belong to the same world as the Tsar&#x2019;s capital, St. Petersburg, a thousand miles away. The older streets, without running water or electricity, wound up the slopes of Mtatsminda, Holy Mountain, until they were impossibly steep, full of crookedly picturesque houses weighed down with balconies, entwined with old vines. Tiflis was a big village where everyone knew everyone else.<br><br>Just behind the military headquarters, on genteel Freilinskaya Street, a stone&#x2019;s throw from the square, lived Stalin&#x2019;s wife, a pretty young Georgian dressmaker named Kato Svanidze, and their newborn son, Yakov. Theirs was a true love match: despite his black moods, Stalin was devoted to Kato, who admired and shared his revolutionary fervour. As she sunned herself and the baby on her balcony, her husband was about to give her, and Tiflis itself, an unholy shock.<br><br>This intimate city was the capital of the Caucasus, the Tsar&#x2019;s wild, mountainous viceroyalty between the Black and the Caspian Seas, a turbulent region of fierce and feuding peoples. Golovinsky Prospect seemed Parisian in its elegance. White neo-classical theatres, a Moorish-style opera house, grand hotels and the palaces of Georgian princes and Armenian oil barons lined the street, but, as one passed the military headquarters, Yerevan Square opened up into an Asiatic potpourri.<br><br>Exotically dressed hawkers and stalls offered spicy Georgian <i>lobio </i>beans and hot <i>khachapuri </i>cheesecake. Water-carriers, street-traders, pickpockets and porters delivered to or stole from the Armenian and Persian Bazaars, the alleyways of which more resembled a Levantine souk than a European city. Caravans of camels and donkeys, loaded with silks and spices from Persia and Turkestan, fruit and wineskins from the lush Georgian countryside, ambled through the gates of the Caravanserai. Its young waiters and errand boys served its clientele of guests and diners, carrying in the bags, unharnessing the camels&#x2013;and watching the square. Now we know from the newly opened Georgian archives that Stalin, Faginlike, used the Caravanserai boys as a prepubescent revolutionary street intelligence and courier service. Meanwhile in one of the Caravanserai&#x2019;s cavernous backrooms, the chief gangsters gave their gunmen a pep talk, rehearsing the plan one last time. Stalin himself was there that morning.<br><br>The two pretty teenage girls with twirling umbrellas and loaded revolvers, Patsia Goldava and Anneta Sulakvelidze, &#x201c;brown-haired, svelte, with black eyes that expressed youth,&#x201d; casually sashayed across the square to stand outside the military headquarters, where they flirted with Russian officers, Gendarmes in smart blue uniforms, and bowlegged Cossacks.<br><br>Tiflis was&#x2013;and still is&#x2013;a languid town of strollers and boulevardiers who frequently stop to drink wine at the many open-air taverns: if the showy, excitable Georgians resemble any other European people, it is the Italians. Georgians and other Caucasian men, in traditional <i>chokha</i>&#x2013;their skirted long coats lined down the chest with bullet pouches&#x2013;swaggered down the streets, singing loudly. Georgian women in black headscarves, and the wives of Russian officers in European fashions, promenaded through the gates of the Pushkin Gardens, buying ices and sherbet alongside Persians and Armenians, Chechens, Abkhaz and Mountain Jews, in a fancy-dress jamboree of hats and costumes.<br><br>Gangs of street urchins&#x2013;<i>kinto</i>s&#x2013;furtively scanned the crowds for scams. Teenage trainee priests, in long white surplices, were escorted by their berobed, bearded priest-teachers from the pillared white seminary across the street, where Stalin had almost qualified as a priest nine years earlier. This un-Slavic, un-Russian and ferociously Caucasian kaleidoscope of East and West was the world that nurtured Stalin.<br><br>Checking the time, the girls Anneta and Patsia parted, taking up new positions on either side of the square. On Palace Street, the dubious clientele of the notorious Tilipuchuri Tavern&#x2013;princes, pimps, informers and pickpockets&#x2013;were already drinking Georgian wine and Armenian brandy, not far from the plutocratic grandeur of Prince Sumbatov&#x2019;s palace.<br><br>Just then David Sagirashvili, another revolutionary who knew Stalin and some of the gangsters, visited a friend who owned a shop above the tavern and was invited in by the cheerful brigand at the doorway, Bachua Kupriashvili, who &#x201c;immediately offered me a chair and a glass of red wine, according to the Georgian custom.&#x201d; David drank the wine and was about to leave when the gunman suggested &#x201c;with exquisite politeness&#x201d; that he stay inside and &#x201c;sample more snacks and wine.&#x201d; David realized that &#x201c;they were letting people <i>into </i>the restaurant but would not let them <i>out</i>. Armed individuals stood at the door.&#x201d;<br><br>Spotting the convoy galloping down the boulevard, Patsia Goldava, the slim brunette on lookout, sped round the corner to the Pushkin Gardens where she waved her newspaper to Stepko Intskirveli, waiting by the gate.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re off!&#x201d; he muttered.<br><br>Stepko nodded at Anneta Sulakvelidze, who was across the street just outside the Tilipuchuri, where she made a sign summoning the others from the bar. The gunmen in the doorway beckoned them. &#x201c;At a given signal&#x201d; Sagirashvili saw the brigands in the tavern put down their drinks, cock their pistols and head out, spreading across the square&#x2013;thin, consumptive young men in wide trousers who had barely eaten for weeks. Some were gangsters, some desperadoes and some, typically for Georgia, were poverty-stricken princes from roofless, wall-less castles in the provinces. If their deeds were criminal, they cared nothing for money: they were devoted to Lenin, the Party and their puppet-master in Tiflis, Stalin.<br><br>&#x201c;The functions of each of us had been planned in advance,&#x201d; remembered a third girl in the gang, Alexandra Darakhvelidze, just nineteen, a friend of Anneta, and already veteran of a spree of heists and shootouts.<br><br>The gangsters each covered the square&#x2019;s policemen&#x2013;the <i>gorodovoi, </i>known in the streets as <i>pharaoh</i>s. Two gunmen marked the Cossacks outside the City Hall; the rest made their way to the corner of Velyaminov Street and the Armenian Bazaar, not far from the State Bank itself. Alexandra Darakhvelidze, in her unpublished memoirs, recalled guarding one of the street corners with two gunmen.<br><br>Now Bachua Kupriashvili, nonchalantly pretending to read a newspaper, spotted in the distance the cloud of dust thrown up by the horses&#x2019; hooves.

Published in 1960, it was very bold for its time in exploring a middle-class Egyptian girl&#39;s coming of sexual and political age, in the context of the Egyptian nationalist movement preceding the 1952 revolution. The novel traces the pressures on young women and young men of that time and class as they seek to free themselves of family control and social expectations. Young Layla and her brother become involved in the student activism of the 1940s and early 1950s and in the popular resistance to continued imperialist rule; the story culminates in the 1956 Suez Crisis, when Gamal Abd al-Nasser&#39;s nationalization of the Canal led to a British, French, and Israeli invasion. Not only daring in her themes, Latifa al-Zayyat was also bold in her use of colloquial Arabic, and the novel contains some of the liveliest dialogue in modern Arabic literature.</p><p>Latifa Al-Zayyat (1923-96) struggled all her life to uphold just causes -- national integrity, the welfare of the poor, human rights, freedom of expression, and the rejection of all forms of imperialist hegemony. As a professor of English literature at Ain Shams University, her critical output was no less prolific than her creative writing, but the creative, academic, and political strands of her personality were interwoven. The Open Door is generally recognized as her magnum opus.&#39;&#39;Not only a great novel, but a literary landmark that shaped our consciousness.&#39;&#39; -- Abdel Moneim Tallima</p><h2>Janet Fish</h2><p>Looks at still lifes and portraits by the Boston-born artist, and shares her comments on her paintings and her approach to art</p><p></p><h2>Especially Maine; The Natural World of Henry Beston from Cape Cod to the St. Lawrence.</h2><p>Book by Beston, Henry</p><p></p><h2>Lucky Starr: Book 1 David Starr, Space Ranger and Lucky Starr and the Pirates of the Asteroids</h2><p>The ruling Council of Science sends David Starr to the rescue of the planet; and Starr battles the space pirates who killed his parents</p><p></p><h2>Rage of Lions (Wereworld)</h2><p><b>The epic Wereworld saga continues in the second installment of this thrilling series!<br><br></b>Picking up where <i>Rise of the Wolf</i> leaves off, the kingdom is in disarray and Drew Ferran is grudgingly being groomed for the throne.

W. Crocker III</b> is the bestselling author of many books on military history, including <i>Don&#x2019;t Tread on Me</i>, <i>Robert E. Lee on Leadership</i>, <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War</i>, <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the British Empire</i>, and the prize-winning comic novel <i>The Old Limey</i>. His journalism has appeared in <i>National Review</i>, the <i>American Spectator</i>, the <i>Washington Times</i>, and many other outlets. Born and raised in San Diego, CA, Crocker currently lives on the site of a former Confederate encampment in Virginia.<br>From <i>Leatherneck Magazine of the Marines</i> <p></p>"H. W. Crocker has just written a book that should make many of the reading lists for both Army and Marine professional education courses. In this year, the 100th anniversary of the start of "The War to End All Wars," Harry Crocker has written a work that resonates from World War I to this day. He is especially complimentary to the United States Marine Corps. <p></p>His skill is evident in his organization of the chapters, which deviates from the expected, chronological linear history. First, he covers the events leading America into war. Then he presents a very comprehensive narrative of the battles after the 'Yanks' arrived. But what makes this work really stand out is the author's keen eye and well-researched chapters on the human element: those who fought and made history by their efforts. <p></p>He starts that section with 'The Generals, ' including a very informative chapter on Marine Major General John A. Lejeune. He also gives ample space to General Douglas MacArthur and the airpower vision of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. <p></p>In his 'Young Lions' segment, he describes those who built on their WW I experience to rise to the challenge in WW II and beyond. Prominent are President Harry S. Truman, GEN George S. Patton, GEN George C. Marshall, MG William J. 'Wild Bill' Donovan (father of the Office of Strategic Services that became the Central Intelligence Agency) and several other heroic yet very modest men: Medal of Honor recipient Sergeant Alvin C. York and the chaplain of the New York 'Fighting 69th, ' Father Duffy, who received the Distinguished Service Cross. <p></p>The book's chapter on future President Truman is especially poignant. The only President to fight in WW I, Captain Truman of Battery D, 129th Field Artillery, had to 'game' his eye exam. The author doesn't stop with just Truman's WW I combat experience; he follows his life forward from ending the war against Japan to creating the Truman Doctrine. <p></p>Crocker describes vignettes with an excellent prose style that makes the book an easy read. One noteworthy contribution is his strong understanding and appreciation for joint operations. Along the way, he treats USMC WW I combat action extremely well in the context of a joint environment. <p></p>In developing joint tactics and fighting with French units, one of the most famous statements in Marine history was spoken. When a French officer told Marine Capt Lloyd 'Josh' Williams that the situation was hopeless and he must retreat, the captain made a statement that stands as long as there will be a Marine Corps: 'Retreat, hell! We just got here.' <p></p>Politics and personalities are not avoided. After initially resisting putting Marines on the front line, GEN John J. Pershing assigned his Army Chief of Staff, BG James Harbord, to take the Marines forward with the words, 'Young man, I'm giving you the best brigade in France. If anything goes wrong, I'll know whom to blame.' Harbord noted later, 'They never failed.' <p></p>The WW I Marines of the 5th and 6th regiments were described as being the best-trained units in the American Expeditionary Forces, 'aggressive with bayonet and famously proud marksmen.' According to Crocker, 'Sixty percent of the entire regiment--mark this--sixty percent were college men. Two-thirds of one entire company came straight from the University of Minnesota.' <p></p>In facing the Marines at Belleau Wood, one German soldier wrote, 'The Americans are savages. They kill everything that moves.' <p></p>In WW I--just like for today's Marines--fighting like they trained was a key element. The author describes the brutality of war while making a very insightful point about training. For WW I trench warfare, the Marines prepared at Quantico, Va. 'At the newly built base at Quantico, they had drilled in muddy trenches to get them ready for the Western Front. But even Quantico's famous mud could not match the miserable lice-ridden, dank dark, waterlogged trenches of France, infested with monstrous rats that feasted on the dead and that Marines bayoneted or shot, treating them like mini-Boche.' <p></p>As the first Marine to command an Army division, MajGen Lejeune gets a chapter to himself. Crocker tells how U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman Lejeune entered the Marine Corps. After the required two years at sea, Midshipman Lejeune returned to take his final exams to become a commissioned officer. Standing sixth in his class, he was slated to be a naval engineer, but he wanted to be a Marine. <p></p>Crocker writes: '[A] naval officer told him, 'Frankly Mister Lejeune, you have altogether too many brains to be lost in the Marine Corps.' ' <p></p>Proving his intelligence, he managed to have that comment repeated to the Commandant of the Marine Corps who then specifically requested Midshipman Lejeune be given a Marine commission. <p></p>The book describes how some of MajGen Lejeune's Army superiors were of mixed opinion of him; 'too independent minded and too ready to question orders, and held suspect Lejeune's style of leading men rather than driving them.' This section reads about right to this day. <p></p>As a between-wars Commandant, July 1920-March 1929, Lejeune is given full credit as 'a deft administrator doing much with the small budget Congress allotted him, including keeping Marine Corps aviation alive and laying the intellectual groundwork for the Marines of the future--as an amphibious assault force.' His guiding light was leading by example, and his fundamental belief was that 'leadership was a moral calling.' <p></p>The book is a worthy read for all interested in combat and the challenges faced by individual Marines and soldiers to their highest leaders. It is a reading journey that is presented with respect and understanding." <p></p>-- Ed Timperlake, former commanding officer of VMFA-321 <p></p>"A rousing military history of an older, and in some ways better, America. The pen portraits of America's heroes in the First World War--whose fame in many cases extends beyond, like Patton, MacArthur, and Truman--are terrific!"<br>--William Peter Blatty, Academy Award-winning screenwriter and bestselling novelist, author of <i>The Exorcist</i>, and co-screenwriter (with Blake Edwards) of the World War I comedy-drama <i>Darling Lili</i> <p></p>"Harry Crocker presents a very readable, lively, and historically rich account of America's involvement in World War One, from strategic-level power politics to the blood and grime of the trenches. The war narrative is complemented with short, incisive biographies of prominent leaders--Pershing, Mitchell, and Lejeune, among others--and the 'Young Lions' such as George Patton, Eddie Rickenbacker, Alvin York, and 'Wild Bill' Donovan. This is an outstanding and enjoyable volume for both seasoned military history buffs and readers who want to know more about the dramatic events that were shaping our present day a century ago."<br>--James S. Robbins, author of <i>The Real Custer</i> <p></p>"A brilliant book. Crocker is the absolute master at creating readable history--and on few subjects is his clarity more needed than on America's involvement in World War I, helping readers to understand and appreciate our commitment and sacrifice. <i>The Yanks Are Coming!</i> is a great book--highly recommended for anyone interested in American military history."<br>--Phillip Jennings, former Marine Corps combat pilot and author of <i>Nam-A-Rama</i> and <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide(TM) to the Vietnam War</i> <p></p>"A great story has met a great writer! Historian Harry Crocker skillfully records the important but often overlooked story of America's pivotal role in winning World War I. Peopled by a fascinating historical cast of characters, The Yanks Are Coming! puts the reader on the front lines with the American doughboys with a you-are-there sense of immediacy. It is a memorable story of American courage and sacrifice, and the author's insightful, fast-paced narrative enlivens it anew. First-rate!"<br>--Rod Gragg, author of <i>The Illustrated Gettysburg Reader</i> and <i>The Pilgrim Chronicles</i> <p></p>"Harry Crocker has tackled one of the most perplexing major wars of modern history, untangling the confusion to deliver a narrative that is not only easy to follow, but a joy to read. Unlike so many histories of the Great War, which draw readers into the snarl of the war's complexity, Crocker's unwinds the sinews, laying them out in plain sight. It is a rare book that can be truly described as hard to put down. If a person was to read just one book about the Great War, there is no better one than this."<br>--Bill Yenne, author of <i>Hap Arnold: The General Who Invented the U.S. Air Force</i> and a contributor to encyclopedias of both world wars<br></p><h2>How &amp; Why Stories (World Storytelling from August House)</h2><p>Did you ever look carefully at a spider&#39;s web?

Bestseller Suarez's sequel to <i>Daemon</i> (2009), in which the late, mad-genius game designer Matthew Sobol launched a cyber war on humanity, surpasses its smart, exciting predecessor. This concluding volume crackles with electrifying action scenes and bristles with intriguing ideas about a frightening, near-future world. Sobol's bots continue to roam the Internet, inciting mayhem and siphoning money from worldwide, interconnected megacorporations out to seize control of national governments and enslave the populace. FBI special agent Roy Merritt is dead, but still manages to make a dramatic comeback, while detective Pete Sebeck, thought to be executed in <i>Daemon</i>, rises from the supposed grave to lead the fight against the corporations. What the trademark letters affixed to the title signify is anyone's guess. Those who haven't read <i>Daemon</i> should read it first. The two books combined form the cyberthriller against which all others will be measured. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

King delivers an intelligent, terrifying, engrossing drama of good and evil, unlike any she has written before....<br><br>A respected university professor, Anne Waverly has a past known to few: Years ago, her own unwitting act cost Anne her husband and daughter. Fewer still know that this history and her academic specialty--alternative religious movements--have made her a brilliant FBI operative. Four times she has infiltrated suspect communities, escaping her own memories of loss and carnage to find a measure of atonement. Now, as she begins to savor life once more, she has no intention of taking another assignment. Until she learns of more than one hundred children living in the Change movement's Arizona compound....<br><br>Anne soon realizes that Change is no ordinary community and hers is no ordinary mission. For, far from appeasing the demons of her past, this assignment is sweeping her back into their clutches...and to the razor's edge of danger.</p><p>Laurie King's 1993 debut novel, <i>A Grave Talent</i>, won American and British honors for Best First Crime Novel, and it quickly established a loyal following for her series featuring San Francisco detectives Kate Martinelli and Alonzo Hawkins. She followed up that early success with a clever expansion of the Sherlock Holmes mythos, <i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i>. That novel, and the three that succeeded it, partnered Holmes with Mary Russell--a woman very much Holmes's equal in spirit and mind despite her young age. <i>A Darker Place</i> is King's first book to break from these series as she continues to pioneer new territory between literary and thriller fiction.<p> The success of <i>A Darker Place</i> comes from its slow revelation of the back story, which illuminates the major players: Anne Waverly, Glen McCarthy, and the people of Change. King brilliantly portrays the psychological split that drives Anne to self-destruction, both in her sexual relationships and in her self-effacing work for the FBI. Though a respected university professor and expert on cults, Anne Waverly was once a cultist herself. For 18 years she has struggled with personal tragedies that wrenched her from that experience, and she has dedicated herself (through academic labor and her covert work for the FBI) to saving the lives of others who become embroiled in religious fanaticism. Now, despite a vow that she has ended her relationship with the FBI and its work in defusing cults, she returns for one last effort at the request of Agent McCarthy. Anne cuts her hair, changes her name, and gradually loses herself in her new role as a member of Change. But her investigation soon becomes a journey into her own psyche, into the dark places of her past, as she sees her own life played out again in the members of the cult. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Praise For Laurie R.

He went on to attain success as a songwriter on Broadway and as the compiler of the definitive <i>Book of American Negro Spirituals</i>. But he achieved one of his greatest triumphs in 1912, when, under a pseudonym, he published <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i> a classic novel about a musician who rejects his black roots, a novel that is still in print today in multiple paperback editions. Johnson went on to be, from 1920 to 1930, the first African-American head of the NAACP, fighting tirelessly for the passage of a federal anti-lynching law. His life story is that of a truly remarkable man who triumphed over a system of institutionalized racism to become one of black America's leading educators, men of letters, and reformers.</p><p>With the possible exceptions of Dr. Alain Locke and W.E.B. Du Bois, no African American excelled on as many different levels as James Weldon Johnson. <i>Along This Way</i>--the first autobiography by a person of color to be reviewed in <i>The New York Times</i>--not only chronicles his life as an educator, lawyer, diplomat, newspaper editor, lyricist, poet, essayist, and political activist but also outlines the trials and triumphs of African Americans from post-Reconstruction to the rise and fall of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Florida in 1871 to middle-class West Indian parents, Johnson recognized the challenges and absurdities of segregated America early on. But it was his experience as a tutor to rural blacks while a student at Atlanta University that was to alter the course of his life: "It was this period that marked the beginning of psychological change from boyhood to manhood," he writes. "It was this period that marked also the beginning of my knowledge of my own people as a race." <p> With a rare blend of pride and humility, Johnson recounts how he, among other accomplishments, became Florida's first black lawyer in 1898, a diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and lyricist for his brother Rosamond Johnson's famous song, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Johnson's commentary on his epochal novel, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>, as well as writings on his works of poetry--<i>The Creation</i>, <i>God's Trombones</i>, and <i>Fifty Years and Other Poems</i>--is priceless. Equally important are the logical and even-tempered opinions on race that he wrote for <i>The New York Age</i>, which offered comprehensive critiques of Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and Marcus Garvey, along with his analysis of the racial climate while serving as head of the NAACP.

Republished in 1927, at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, with an introduction by Carl Van Vechten, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man became a groundbreaking document of Afro-American culture; the first first-person novel ever written by a black, it became an eloquent model for later novelists ranging from Zora Neale Hurston to Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. <br>Narrated by a man whose light skin enables him to "pass" for white, the novel describes a journey through the strata of black society at the turn of the century -- from a cigar factory in Jacksonville to an elite gambling club in New York, from genteel aristocrats to the musicians who hammered out the rhythms of ragtime. The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man is a complex and moving examination of the question of race and an unsparing look at what it meant to forge an identity as a man in a culture that recognized nothing but color.</p><h2>Christianity and Classical Culture: The Metamorphosis of Natural Theology in the Christian Encounter with Hellenism (Gifford Lectures Series)</h2><p>Provides an account of the lives and writings of the Cappadocians, showing how they managed to be Greek and Christian at the same time.

As a journalist and foreign service officer in the postwar years, he reported on and subsequently fought in the political and propaganda wars of the Cold War in Latin America and the Soviet Union. Staples then devoted his career to institution and nation-building in Asia and the new republics emerging from the wreckage of the Soviet Union.Drawing on those decades of experience, Staples suggests how we might reorder our foreign affairs priorities more effectively. The American response to the challenge of terrorism rests heavily on military and security approaches. It devotes little serious attention to the long-term questions of how best to go about nation-building or how to fight propaganda wars.Staples believes we have little choice but to reform that approach. The new challenges in foreign policy won&#39;t go away, and only rarely is the military option the right answer. Foresight, patience, pragmatism-and international cooperation-are the names of the cards we must play.</p><p>Eugene Staples was born in a railroad and farming family in Missouri. After flying Marine fighters in World War II, he worked for twenty-five years overseas as a journalist, diplomat, and foundation executive.Excerpt from Chapter Thirteen: A Farm in The Punjab<p></p><p>To run the farm, I hired an enthusiastic, retired agronomist from the government agricultural service as manager. Mr. Ramanathan regarded me as heaven-sent, a male incarnation of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and, in acknowledgement of the superior wisdom of the gods, left no rupee unspent in order for us to be able to boast of the best small farm in northern India. With the help of two taciturn, stick-thin Punjabi farm laborers, we planted wheat and potatoes, some of which we ate but most of which we sold, and cared for the lemon and orange grove, whose fruit was small and sweet and brought a good price in the market. I hired a night watchman, who, in the best tradition of Asian folk tales, mostly slept. For the weeding, we hired work gangs of tough, local farmwomen, who giggled when I put on running shorts and jogged around a perimeter trail the laborers built on my instruction. Many of the younger women were stunning -- tan, rosy skin, aquiline noses, and ravishing dark eyes which they used to their best effect in the direct, proud gaze of Punjabi women. In spite of their strenuous manual labor, with childbearing and a diet of buffalo milk, wheat chapattis (flat, unleavened bread), and clarified butter, they became fat-haunched early on, which is what Punjabi men prefer. The Bengali writer Nirad Chaudhuri, an unerring observer of Indian taste and psychology, wrote that "the Punjabi feminine body is seen at its best from behind, and that is also how the Punjabi men love best to gape at their women. When they see one of them approaching from the front, a hard and tense stare appears in their eyes, and there is in it only an expectation and no enjoyment; but as soon as the woman has passed them and they have, according to their invariable habit, made a rightabout turn to look at her from the back, the eyes soften and a soft sigh escapes from their bosom.".</p><p></p><p>My first-hand dealings with the Indian land and its fauna and flora made me an insufferable instant expert in my work on economic development problems with my colleagues at the Ford Foundation and elsewhere in New Delhi, many of whom were economists or other social scientists and engineers, both Indian and Western. They lived in modern houses and walled compounds in the sprawling city, and only occasionally, if ever, heard the price of wheat and potatoes from their cooks. On the farm, on the other hand, from day to day we knew what bugs were eating the wheat, how an unexpected high wind shattered the grain, and how villainously low were the futures prices quoted by the itinerant commodity traders, who all across the subcontinent take to the side roads as the grain and fruit crops ripen. In northern India, the Sikhs and the Punjabis make money out of farming. I was neither. We spared no expense and produced India's highest cost wheat and potatoes. </p><p></p><p>But I regarded us as fortunate. In India, land and water are life itself, and on this blessed little farm, even in the burning, pre-monsoon heat and drought days of May and June, when great flocks of swallows cascaded down the yellow sky over the mango groves, and the earth was faint, and slow, distant thunder growled over the distant plains, our small tube-well delivered torrents of marvelously cold, sweet water for drinking and irrigation. The flame trees were fire-bright in the pre-monsoon heat. In the monsoon rains, nature exploded into growth, plants almost visibly rising and burgeoning before your eyes. In the autumn, the scent of sun-warmed lemon and orange blossoms filled our days, and in the still, clear winter our roses were exquisite. P&lt;&gt;</p><p>The plains pulsated with life. Tame little gray doves cooed in the fruit groves. Partridges scuttled in the bushes. A dozen peacocks nested in the neem trees that marked the border of our land, by night interrupting our sleep with their Macbethian wailings. By day, the enormous burnished birds, who wrought havoc in the vegetable garden (peacocks will eat virtually anything), nonchalantly defied my sporadic efforts to encourage them to move on--a direct hit with an air rifle produced a small plop against the thick layer of lustrous feathers, a slight hop of surprise, and then back to the business of feeding. One evening, to my amazement and dismay, I killed a peacock with the air rifle while aiming at a barely visible blob high in a tree against a darkening sky. I had fired and begun to walk on when suddenly an enormous object plummeted to the ground. I had hit a peahen in its eye. Killing peacocks is illegal in India, so I hauled the dead bird over to the fence and, looking around me guiltily, left it by the side of the road. The carcass was gone in the morning, probably carried away by semi-wild dogs. Green parrots shrieked their song of gluttony in my papaya trees, and sometimes when I dozed in a deck chair in the garden shade I was awakened by papaya pulp raining onto my hair. One day, we found an old cobra living in a deserted pump-house, coping not very well with its job of eating the constantly multiplying hordes of field rats that burrowed in the mud irrigation channels and sallied forth by night to feast on the ripening grain. The gardeners promptly dispatched him with a hoe. The rats got worse.

In The Gentle Discipline Book, Sarah Ockwell-Smith debunks many commonly held beliefs about punishment and motivation, and provides an alternative approach that will empower you to discipline your child in an effective way and with respect. Gentle discipline is not about mollycoddling your child or being a pushover - it means understanding your child, having realistic expectations of them, and responding to their misbehavior appropriately. It focuses on teaching and learning, not punishment or rewarding. In her trademark practical style, Sarah offers solutions for coping with the most common discipline challenges, including: whining and sulking, aggressive and destructive behavior, not listening and refusal to do things, rudeness and backchat, sibling rivalry, lying, swearing, low self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence. The advice is appropriate to a wide range of ages, from toddler to teenager, and, if you have been using more traditional forms of discipline, it will give you the tools - and the confidence - to change to a more mindful approach.</p><p>Sarah Ockwell-Smith is the mother of four children. She has a BSc in Psychology and worked for several years in Pharmaceutical Research and Development. Following the birth of her first child, Sarah re-trained as a Paediatric Homeopath, Antenatal Teacher and Birth and Postnatal Doula. She has also undertaken training in Baby Massage, Hypnotherapy and Psychotherapy. Sarah specialises in gentle parenting methods and is co-founder of the GentleParenting website (www.gentleparenting.co.uk). Sarah writes a parenting blog (www.sarahockwell-smith.com), which is read by 3 million parents per year, and is the author of BabyCalm, ToddlerCalm, The Gentle Sleep Book and The Gentle Parenting Book. She frequently writes for magazines and newspapers, and is often called upon as a parenting expert for national television and radio.Chapter 1<br><br> Why Children Misbehave<br><br> In this chapter, we will look at the most common reasons for misbehavior-that is, children's behavior that is deemed undesirable and difficult. It is impossible to discipline gently and effectively without a good understanding of the triggers of misbehavior. Far too many experts concentrate on "fixing the problem" without helping parents understand why it happened in the first place. Any discipline that focuses solely on "the solution" actually disempowers you as a parent. Remember that a good teacher has a good understanding of their subject, and to achieve this they must first take the place of the student. Understanding the reasons for your child's undesirable behavior is the starting point for knowing how to improve it. So with our student hats on, let's step into the world of the child and try to understand things from his point of view.<br><br> Do you ever tantrum? As adults we tend to refer to our own tantrums as "losing control," "exploding," or "meltdowns." Similar words are used to describe tantrums in the teenage years. The fact is that everyone, regardless of age, has to deal with overwhelming emotions from time to time, and some cope with them better than others. In fact, we often expect behavior from our kids that we are not fully capable of ourselves.<br><br> Life is difficult and confusing. We all have a lot to deal with on a daily basis, and if we as adults don't navigate the journey perfectly at all times, then we shouldn't demand that our children do. So accepting that your child will have meltdowns and tantrums, just as you do sometimes, is perhaps the best way forward. Resetting your expectations, starting with the baseline that everyone misbehaves from time to time, is a great starting point.<br><br> In chapter 3 we will look at the neurological basis of behavior and how this changes during childhood. The human brain differs dramatically from babies to teens to adults, which means it is unrealistic to expect children to behave in the same manner as adults. Perhaps the largest difference is in the area responsible for impulse control and regulation of emotions-which is why resetting expectations for behavior so that they are age appropriate is so fundamental to gentle discipline. For the remainder of this chapter, however, we will focus on nonneurological causes of undesirable behavior, although the two are always linked. There are undoubtedly environmental triggers, but a child's brain-whether she is a teen or a toddler-is not like that of an adult, and this immaturity will always play a role in her undesirable behavior, simply because she cannot control her actions as well as an adult can.<br><br> Physiological Behavior Triggers<br><br> Have you observed that particular triggers of your child's behavior are of a physiological nature? My children are all noticeably more cranky when they are tired, hungry, or when they've had too much screen time. I can also tell when they have had friendship issues or trouble at school by their behavior. Knowing their triggers allows me to prepare for, preempt, and-sometimes-avoid any related bad behavior. It also helps me to not take their behavior personally. From the child's point of view, it's useful if they can recognize and avoid triggers independently, without parental help, although it is the parents' role to teach them about these initially. While toddlers, preschoolers, and even infants might understand the negative effects of certain behaviors, it is quite unlikely that they will always be able to avoid them without parental help. But in the tween (roughly ages eight to thirteen) and teen years, children can become quite proficient at avoiding certain triggers without any adult input.<br><br> So let's explore some common behavior triggers in children of all ages. They are in no particular order, and the list is by no means complete. Remember that each child is unique, and that his or her triggers reflect this; finding your child's own particular triggers is what's most important.<br><br> Diet<br><br> For many kids, diet can play a tremendous role in their behavior, and parents often notice significant changes after focusing on this for several weeks. Despite popular opinion, sugar does not make children hyperactive. It is undoubtedly not healthy, but poor behavior is frequently wrongly blamed on a "sugar rush." Conversely, low blood sugar, or rather, low blood-glucose levels, may affect behavior. The body releases a compensatory amount of adrenaline in response to a fall in blood glucose, known as hypoglycemia. This chain of events can cause a negative change in behavior-a phenomenon sometimes referred to as being "hangry," a combination of hunger and anger, largely caused by the change in glucose and adrenaline levels. Simply making sure that children avoid becoming overly hungry can often have a positive effect on behavior.<br><br> One specific dietary factor that can have an effect on behavior is artificial additives. While the varieties are too numerous to explore in depth here, it's important to note that chemical additives, such as those found in breakfast cereals, chips, candy, juices, and even children's medicines, have been linked to hyperactivity. If you suspect your child may be affected, be sure to check the ingredients lists on the product packaging and speak to your pediatrician.<br><br> Deficiencies in diet can also play a part. In 2013, research on nearly five hundred children between seven and nine years old found that low levels of omega-3, long-chain polyunsaturated fats were associated with increased behavior problems, a lowered reading ability, and poorer memory.<br><br> If you suspect that your child's behavior may be worsened by dietary triggers, the place to start is with a food diary, noting everything your child eats and their behavior daily over a couple of weeks. This can help to provide insight into any negative reaction to foods, particularly additives. Analyzing their diet can also help to identify any nutritional deficiencies. Ideally, all of your child's nutritional needs will be met via their diet. Omega-3, for instance, can be found in oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon, and tuna, as well as flaxseeds, which can be easily added to breakfast cereals. But when that's not the case, a nutritionist can advise on supplements that might help to prevent hyperactive behavior due to dietary deficiencies.<br><br> Lack of Sleep<br><br> Have you noticed a change in your child's behavior when they are tired? Toddlers who have skipped a nap tend to be grouchy, short-tempered, and sometimes clumsy. The same is true at any age (including us adults). I can always tell when my teenager has had a late night for exactly the same reasons.<br><br> But how long should your child sleep? No one really knows. At best, experts can provide fairly broad ranges for each age; however, sleep needs are unique, and while some kids function perfectly well on eight hours' sleep in a twenty-four-hour period, others may need closer to twelve. The following table, based on advice from the National Sleep Foundation, is a good guide to sleep needs by age:<br><br> Bedtimes that are too early, as well as too late, can mean that a child will not get enough sleep. If they are put to bed before their body is biologically ready for sleep, research shows that they take longer to fall asleep and are more likely to wake overnight. A good bedtime for kids under eleven years of age is somewhere between eight and nine o'clock. Teenagers, on the other hand, are not biologically ready for sleep until much later. Research shows that the sleep patterns of thirteen- and fourteen-year-olds undergo a phase delay-that is, a tendency toward sleeping at later times. This applies to both bedtime and wake time, with a typical sleep onset time of eleven o'clock at night. The problem here is that at this age most children still need at least eight or nine hours' sleep per night, yet they are expected to get up for school. The early school start is at odds with their biological sleep needs, which invariably means that they go to school having had too little sleep-and this sleep deficit can create or contribute to many behavioral issues.<br><br> In addition to bedtimes, another major issue kids struggle with when trying to get enough sleep is lighting. Research has shown that blue, or short-wave, light sources trick the brain into thinking it is still daytime and inhibit the body's secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. Any night-lights in your child's room that are not red (in terms of the light emitted) can inhibit their sleep. Red light is the only one that does not inhibit the secretion of melatonin. And it's not just conventional lighting that causes an issue with sleep-screens such as televisions, smartphones, and tablets also emit large amounts of blue light. So these devices keep children awake due to biological responses, as well as the obvious temptation to play on them. Screens have no place in your child's bedroom, or even in the hour or two leading up to bedtime.<br><br> Sensory Overload<br><br> Have you ever felt overwhelmed by your environment? Perhaps a place filled with many different smells, loud sounds, and lots of people bumping into you? I personally find the London Underground to be a bit of an assault on my senses, and whenever I travel into London I am always grumpy and exhausted for the remainder of the day.<br><br> Many years ago, I was exhibiting at a baby show in a very large hall that was lit by rows of spotlight tracks suspended from the ceiling, bathing everything in high levels of artificial light. My stall was located next to the stage where several product demonstrations and fashion shows took place throughout the day, all accompanied by loud music, while the smells of toiletries, aromatherapy, and curry from a nearby food stall filled the air. At least a thousand people attended, jostling one another and navigating strollers and baby gear through the busier areas. At the end of each day's exhibiting, I went home with a pounding headache due to the sensory overload, while almost all of the visitors at my stall complained that their children were grumpy, grizzly, and irritable, although most greeted me with, "Hi, I'm sorry, I don't know why my child is so unhappy." I told them all to look up at the bright lights and imagine how they would feel if they were reclining in a stroller and staring at them throughout their visit. Then I asked them to imagine being surrounded by hundreds of pairs of legs bumping into them and trying to sleep through the throbbing music and the cries of other children in their ears. And then I asked if they would feel irritable in the same situation. Sometimes stepping into the shoes of your child can give you all the answers you need.<br><br> Now imagine how your child feels when she starts school for the first time at the age of four or five. At nursery or preschool she was used to a small space and probably fewer children. Once they start school they are, for one thing, the youngest, usually out of at least a hundred children. The buildings are bigger and the sounds amplified. Is it any wonder that they struggle with feelings of being totally overwhelmed?<br><br> Imagine going through all of this again at the age of eleven. Starting middle school is by far the most difficult transition for most kids. If you found yourself in a new environment and battling to make sense of it all, you might find that you were grumpy and short tempered at the end of the day too. And imagine that you've been trying hard to "keep it together" all day, but now that you're home, with those you love and trust, you can finally "let it all out" and release your authentic emotions.<br><br> So many children go through this when they start a new school, yet their parents don't understand why they are irritable and "naughty" when they get home. They complain of school reports that speak of a child who's polite and mature, yet at home they are anything but. This behavior is common and understandable-the child is finally home from day care or school and feels it is safe to drop the fa ade in the presence of people she loves and trusts. For parents this can be hard to handle, especially if they believe that the child is being "naughty on purpose." In fact, her behavior shows what a great job the parents are doing, by making the child feel secure and supported enough to be able to show her true emotions.<br><br> While most children will battle with feelings of being overwhelmed at particular moments and transitions, there are others who struggle on a daily basis. Research has shown that one out of six children experiences auditory and tactile sensory symptoms serious enough to negatively impact everyday life. Further research conducted in the United States has shown that one in twenty children experiences sensory processing disorder (SPD), often described as a disorganization of sensory signals and responses in the brain, affecting different senses. Children with SPD may find it harder to process auditory or tactile stimuli or cope with sensations. This can manifest in either an over- or an underresponse. For instance, some children may find it very hard to cope with certain fabrics touching their skin, to the point where they find it unbearable. Some may find certain lighting or sounds disturbing and some may not process certain sensations, such as heat and cold, and thus expose themselves to dangerous situations. No one cause of SPD is known; however, it is likely to be a result of a combination of genetics and environmental influences and situations.<br><br> Symptoms of SPD are often found on a spectrum, with some more severe than others. As babies and toddlers, children with SPD are often described as "fussy" or "very high need." They can often struggle with sleep and eating and may cry to be held, but then arch away once in their parents' arms. They can also often be extremely active, yet slow to achieve physical milestones; in the toddler years, toilet training can be very difficult. As they grow up, eating and sleeping problems may continue and they can experience more tantrums than average as they strive to cope with stimulation. Body contact with others can be challenging too and they are said to "overreact" to different experiences. They can often seem to be uncoordinated and find it hard to master fine motor skills.<br><br> Treatment for SPD is multifaceted and often involves occupational therapy and a therapeutic, sensory-rich environment to help to challenge children in a fun and safe way. Many parents also report success with alternative approaches with complementary therapies. Sensory objects that can help a child to cope on an everyday basis, especially at school, include special "chewy" jewelry, stress balls, and "fiddle" objects that aid concentration and fulfill their sensory needs in a socially acceptable way.</p><h2>JFK Has Been Shot</h2><p>"Thrilling, dramatic, historic." --Robert K.

But his is a joyous ennui, if such a thing is possible, one that relishes the boredom of everyday life with a Zen enthusiasm.

Murder, obsession, sex, and war are all just distractions as he tries to construct a sensible portrait from the odd bits and pieces he finds in his travels.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><br><br><em>Blue River, Texas November</em><br><br>The evil brides were gaining on her, closing the gap.<br><br>Paige Remington ran blindly down a dark country road, legs pumping, lungs burning, her heart flailing in her throat. Slender tree branches plucked at her from either side with nimble, spidery fingers, slowing her down, and the ground turned soft under her feet.<br><br>She pitched forward onto her hands and knees. Felt pebbles dig into her palms.<br><br>Behind her, the brides screeched and cackled in delighted triumph.<br><br>"This is only a dream," Paige told herself. <em>"Wake up."</em><br><br>Still, sleep did not release her.<br><br>Flurries of silk and lace, glittering with tiny rhinestones and lustrous with the glow of seed pearls, swirled around her. She felt surrounded, almost smothered.<br><br>Suddenly furious, the dream-Paige surged to her feet.<br><br>If the monsters wanted a fight, then by God, she'd give it to them.<br><br>Confronting her pursuers now, staring directly at them, Paige recognized the brides. They were&#x2014;and at the same time, in that curious way of dreams, <em>were not&#x2014;</em>her sisters, Libby and Julie.<br><br>Wedding veils hid their faces, but she knew them anyway. Libby wore a luscious vintage gown of shimmering ivory, while Julie's dress was ultramodern, a little something she'd picked up on a recent romantic getaway to Paris.<br><br>"We just want you to try on your bridesmaid's dress," the pair said in creepy unison. "That's all."<br><br>"No," Paige said. "I'm not trying on the damn dress. Leave me alone."<br><br>They advanced on her. Garment bags had materialized in their arms.<br><br>"But you're our only bridesmaid," the two chorused.<br><br>"No!" Paige repeated, trying to retreat but stuck fast.<br><br>It was then that a voice penetrated the thick surface of the dream. "Hey," the voice said, low and male and disturbingly familiar. "You okay?"<br><br>She felt a hand on her shoulder and woke up with a jolt.<br><br>And a faceful of Austin McKettrick.<br><br>"It just keeps getting worse," she marveled, gripping the arms of the poolside chair where she'd fallen asleep after a solitary lunch in the ranch-house kitchen.<br><br>Austin laughed, drew up a chair himself and eased into it with the care of a man much older than his twenty-eight years. His beard was coming in, buttery-brown, and his hair looked a little shaggy.<br><br>It ought to require a license, being that good-looking.<br><br>"Gee," he drawled. "Thanks."<br><br>It galled Paige that after all this time, he could still make her heart flutter. "What are you doing here?" she demanded.<br><br>Austin settled back, popping the top on a beer can, letting her know he meant to take his sweet time answering. A scruffy-looking dog meandered in and settled at his booted feet with a little huff of contented resignation.<br><br>"I reckon if anybody's going to demand explanations around here," Austin said at long last, "it ought to be me. I <em>live </em>here, Paige."<br><br>She'd set herself up for that one. Even seen it coming. And she'd been unable to get out of the way.<br><br>Paige drew a deep breath, released it slowly. "I've been staying in the guest suite for a couple of days," she said after a few moments. "The lease was up on my apartment and the renovations on our old house aren't quite finished, so&#x2014;"<br><br>Austin's eyes were a lethal shade of blue&#x2014;"heirloom" blue, as Paige thought of it, a mixture of new denim and summer sky and every hue in between. According to local legend, the McKettricks had been passing that eye color down for generations.<br><br>He studied her for a long time before speaking again. Set the beer aside without taking a sip. "My brothers," he said, "are marrying your sisters."<br><br>Paige sighed. "So I've heard," she said.<br><br>Austin ignored the slightly snippy response, went on as if she hadn't said anything. "That means," he told her, "that you and I are going to have to learn to be civil to each other. In spite of our history."<br><br>Paige recalled some of that history&#x2014;youthful, frenzied lovemaking upstairs in Austin's boyhood bedroom, the two of them dancing under the stars to music spilling from the radio in his relic of a truck.<br><br>And the fights. She closed her eyes, remembering the fights, and her cheeks burned pink.<br><br>"Paige?"<br><br>She glared at him.<br><br>"Is it a deal?" he asked quietly.<br><br>"Is <em>what </em>a deal?" she snapped.<br><br>Austin sighed, shoved a hand through his hair. He looked thinner than the last time she'd seen him, and shadows moved behind the light in his eyes. If she hadn't known better, she would have thought he was in pain&#x2014; maybe physical, maybe emotional. Maybe both.<br><br>He leaned toward her, spoke very slowly and very clearly, as though addressing a foreigner with language challenges. "Whether we like it or not, we're going to be kin, you and me, once New Year's rolls around. My guess is, my brothers and your sisters will still be married at the crack of doom. There'll be a whole lot of Christmases and Thanksgivings and birthday parties to get through, over the years. All of which means&#x2014;"<br><br>"I <em>know </em>what it means," Paige broke in. "And what's with the condescending tone of voice?"<br><br>Austin raised both eyebrows. A grin quirked at one corner of his mouth but never quite kicked in. "What's with the bitchy attitude? " he countered. Then he snapped the fingers of his right hand. "Oh, <em>that's </em>right. It's just your normal personality."<br><br>Paige rode out another surge of irritation. Much as she hated to admit it, Austin had a point.<br><br>Libby was marrying Tate. Julie was marrying Garrett. Tate's twins, Audrey and Ava, were already part of the family, of course, and so was Julie's little boy, Calvin.<br><br>And both couples wanted more kids, right away. Oh, yes, there would be a lot of birthday parties to attend.<br><br>"Could we try this again?" Paige asked, trying to sound unruffled.<br><br>Austin tented his fingers under his chin and watched her with an expression of solemn merriment that was all his own. "Sure," he replied, all fake generosity and ironic goodwill. "Go ahead and say something friendly&#x2014;you can do it. Just pretend I'm a human being."<br><br>Paige looked away, and a deep and inexplicable sadness swept over her. "We're never going to get anywhere at this rate," she said.<br><br>Time seemed to freeze for an instant, then grind into motion again, gears catching on rusty gears.<br><br>And then Austin leaned forward, took a light grip on her hand, ran the pad of his thumb over her knuckles.<br><br>A hot shiver went through her; he might have been touching her in all those secret, intimate places no one else had found.<br><br>"You're right," Austin said, his tone husky. "We're not. Let's give it a shot, Paige&#x2014;getting along, I mean."<br><br>He looked sincere. He <em>sounded </em>sincere.<br><br><em>Watch out, </em>Paige reminded herself silently. "Okay," she said with dignity.<br><br>Another silence followed. Paige, for her part, was trying to imagine what a truce between herself and Austin would actually <em>look </em>like. After all, they'd been at odds since that summer night, soon after they'd both graduated from high school, when Paige had caught the lying, sneaking, no-good bastard&#x2014;<br><br>She drew another deep breath, mentally untangled herself from the past. As best she could.<br><br>They'd gotten together by accident, in the beginning&#x2014;<br><br>Tate and Libby were going to a movie one Friday night, and, grudgingly, Tate had brought his younger brother along. Paige had gotten the impression that their parents had insisted, and if Tate had refused, it would have been a deal breaker.<br><br>Paige had been curled up in an armchair reading a book when Austin turned that fabled charm on her, grinned and asked if she'd like to go to a movie.<br><br>After that, she and Austin had been as inseparable as Libby and Tate.<br><br>Paige had thought he was playing some game at first, but after a few months, they were a couple. After a year, Paige was on the pill, and they were making love.<br><br>Yes, she'd been in love with Austin. She'd lost&#x2014;okay, <em>given&#x2014;</em>her virginity to him, along with her trust and, of course, her heart.<br><br>Ultimately, he'd betrayed her.<br><br>But all that had happened just over ten years ago, before his folks, Jim and Sally McKettrick, were killed in that awful car accident, before her own dad had died of cancer. So very much had happened in the interim and, well, Paige was tired of holding a grudge.<br><br>"You were having a bad dream before?" Austin asked presently.<br><br>"Huh?" Paige said.<br><br>"When I woke you up a little while ago?"<br><br>"Yes," she answered, smiling a little. "Thanks for that."<br><br>He grinned, making the pit of her stomach quiver for a moment, then reached for his can of beer. Raised it slightly in an offhand toast. "Anytime," he said.<br><br>The dog whimpered, chasing something in his sleep. Or running away from something.<br><br>"Shep," Austin said, nudging the animal gently with the toe of one boot. "Easy, now. You're all right."<br><br>Paige looked down at Shep. "A stray?"<br><br>Austin grinned again. This time, there was no smartass edge to his tone. "What gave him away? The matted coat? The dirt, maybe?"<br><br>"The poor thing <em>could </em>use a bath," Paige admitted. She'd always had a soft spot for animals&#x2014;especially the abused, neglected and unwanted ones.<br><br>"Garrett promised to hose him down before supper," Austin said. The way he spoke, it was no big deal.<br><br>Paige met his gaze, puzzled and not a little annoyed. "Supper's a ways off," she pointed out.<br><br>"He'll keep," Austin told her. "Won't you, Shep?"<br><br>Paige glanced at her watch. She still had more than an hour before she was due to pick Calvin up in town, at day care. Although she was a nurse by profession, she was between jobs at the moment, as well as between homes. Since Julie was practically meeting herself coming and going these days, between getting ready for the big wedding, holding down her teaching job at the high school and directing the student musical production, Paige had been looking after her nephew a lot lately.<br><br>Since she adored Calvin, it was no hardship.<br><br>She stood. "I'll do it," she said.<br><br>"Do what?" Austin asked.<br><br>"Bathe the dog," Paige answered, proud of herself for not adding, <em>since you can't be bothered to do the job yourself.</em><br><br>"I told you," Austin said, frowning. "Garrett will take care of Shep when he gets home."<br><br>"No sense in putting it off," Paige said, feeling sorry for the critter.<br><br>Shep hauled himself to his feet, watching her with a combination of wariness and hope. His tail swished tentatively to one side, then the other.<br><br>And Paige's heart warmed and softened, like so much beeswax.<br><br>She crouched, looked straight into the dog's limpid brown eyes.<br><br>"I wouldn't hurt you," she said very gently. "Not for the world."<br><br>Shep wagged again, this time with more trust, more spirit.<br><br>"Paige," Austin interjected cautiously, "he's sort of wild and he probably hasn't had his shots&#x2014;"<br><br>Paige put out a hand, let Shep sniff her fingers and palm and wrist.<br><br>She felt something akin to exultation when he didn't retreat. "Nonsense," she said. "He's a sweetheart. Aren't you, Shep?"<br><br>She straightened, saw that Austin was standing, too. If it hadn't been for the dog, the man would practically have been on top of her. So to speak.<br><br>Heat pulsed in her cheeks.<br><br>Something mischievous and far too knowing danced in Austin's eyes. He folded his arms and tilted his head to one side, watching her. She had no clue what he was thinking, and that was even more unsettling.<br><br>In order to break the spell, Paige turned and headed for the main part of the house, moving resolutely.<br><br>She felt a little zing of triumph when she glanced back and saw the dog hesitate, then fall into step behind her.<br><br>Austin couldn't really blame the dog for trailing after Paige&#x2014;watching that perfect blue-jeaned backside of hers as she walked away left him with little choice but to do likewise. Still, it stung his pride that Shep hadn't waited for him.<br><br>Whose dog <em>was </em>he, anyhow?<br><br>Paige's apparently. She led the way, like some piper in a fairy tale, with Shep padding right along in her wake, and that was how the three of them ended up in the laundry room, off the kitchen.<br><br>Paige knew her way around&#x2014;she rustled up some old towels and the special mutt shampoo Julie kept around for Harry&#x2014;and started the water running in one of the big sinks. She spooled out the hand-sprayer and pressed the squirter with a practiced thumb, testing the temperature against the underside of her left wrist.<br><br>The sight, ordinary as it was, did something peculiar to Austin.<br><br>"Well," Paige said, dropping her gaze to the dog and then letting it fly back to Austin's face, "don't just stand there. Hoist Shep up into the sink so I can wash him." She smiled at Shep. "You're going to feel so much better, once you've had your bath," she assured the critter.<br><br>Austin had his pride. He wasn't <em>about </em>to tell this woman that he'd blown out his back and couldn't risk lifting one skinny dog off the floor because he might wind up in traction or something.<br><br>He leaned down and carefully looped his arms under Shep's belly. Set him gently in the laundry sink.<br><br>Paige introduced Shep to the sprayer with a few little blasts of warm water, and gave him time to sort out how he felt about the experience.<br><br>Austin, meanwhile, was just about to congratulate himself on getting away with lifting the dog when he felt a stabbing ache in the same part of his back as when he'd had to be half carried out of Pinky's bar last month. He drew in a sharp breath and grasped the edge of the long counter, where the housekeeper, Esperanza, usually folded sheets and towels.<br><br><em>Steady, </em>he thought. <em>Wait it out.</em><br><br>Paige, preoccupied with sluicing down the dog and apparently oblivious to the way the water was soaking the front of her skimpy T-shirt, paid Austin no attention at all. And that was fine by him, mostly.<br><br>The spasm in Austin's back intensified, a giant charley horse that he couldn't walk off like one in his calf or the arch of his foot. He bit down hard on his lower lip and shut his eyes.<br><br>"Austin?" Paige's voice had changed. It was soft, worried-sounding. "Is something wrong? You're sort of pale and&#x2014;"<br><br>Austin shook his head. The spasm was beginning to subside, though it still hurt like holy-be-Jesus, but talking was beyond him.<br><br>He wouldn't risk meeting her gaze. Back when they were just kids and hot and heavy into dating, Paige had shown a disturbing ability to read his mind&#x2014;not to mention his soul&#x2014;through his eyes.<br><br>Not that she'd been infallible in that regard.<br><br>Or maybe, when it really counted, she'd been too mad to look long enough, hard enough.<br><br>"I'm&#x2014;fine," he finally said. The pain was letting up.<br><br>Paige reached for the dog shampoo, squeezed a glistening trail of it down Shep's sodden back and began to suds him up.<br><br>"Excuse me," she said matter-of-factly, "but you don't <em>look </em>fine."<br><br></p><h2>Black Shoe Carrier Admiral: Frank Jack Fletcher at Coral Sea, Midway &amp; Guadalcanal</h2><p>An abundance of new evidence demanded this reevaluation of Frank Jack Fletcher, the ?black shoe? admiral who won his battles at sea but lost the war of public opinion. A surface warrior?in contrast to a ?brown shoe? naval aviator--Fletcher led the carrier forces that won against all odds at Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons. These and other early carrier victories decided the Pacific War not only because they inflicted crippling losses but also because they denied Japan key strategic positions in the region. Despite these successes, by 1950 Fletcher had become one of the most controversial figures in U.S. naval history and portrayed as a timid bungler who failed to relieve Wake Island in December 1941 and who deliberately abandoned the Marines at Guadalcanal.<br><br>In this book, author John Lundstrom recalls that Fletcher once remarked,"after an action is over, people talk a lot about how the decisions were deliberately reached, but actually there's always a hell of a lot of groping around," and notes that the goal of his study is to probe and explain the "groping around." Drawing on new material, Lundstrom offers a fresh look at Fletcher's decisions and actions. The first major reassessment in more than fifty years of the once-maligned naval officer, it provides a careful analysis of the effect of radio intelligence on decision-making in the carrier battles during the first nine months of the war in the Pacific. This new assessment is based on thousands of documents and massive dispatch files and personal papers that no historian has previously used.</p><p>John B. Lundstrom is Curator Emeritus of History at the Milwaukee Public Museum where he has worked since 1967. He is the author of five books, including The First Team and The First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign and coauthor of Fateful Rendezvous: The Life of Butch O&#x2019;Hare."It is very difficult to turn around a half century of conventional wisdom, but John Lundstrom has done it. In a careful but readable way, he has proved that Adm. Jack Fletcher deserves to be remembered as a hero and not a goat." --<b>Evan Thomas, author of <i>Sea of Thunder</i></b></p><h2>Leonardo Da Vinci The Complete Paintings (Vol. 1)</h2><p>Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) possessed one of the greatest minds of all time; his importance and influence are inestimable.

Julia Diggins masterfully recreates the atmosphere of ancient times, when men, using three simple tools, the string, the straightedge, and the shadow, discovered the basic principles and constructions of elementary geometry. Her book reveals how these discoveries related to the early civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece. The fabric of the story is woven out of archeological and historical records and legends about the major men of mathematics. By reconstructing the events as they might have happened, Diggins enables the attentive reader to easily follow the pattern of reasoning that leads to an ingenious proof of the Pythagorean theorem, an appreciation of the significance of the Golden Mean in art and architecture, and the construction of the five regular solids. Out of print for 34 years, Julia Diggins&#39; classic book is back and is a must-read for middle school students or for parents helping their children through their first geometry course. You will be fascinated with the graphic illustrations and written depiction of how the knowledge and wisdom of so many cultures helped shape our civilization today. This book is popular with teachers and parents who use Jamie York&#39;s Making Math Meaningful curriculum books.</p><p></p><h2>Trading in Danger</h2><p>Kylara Vatta is the only daughter in a family full of sons, and her father&#x2019;s only child to buck tradition by choosing a military career instead of joining the family business. For Ky, it&#x2019;s no contest: Even running the prestigious Vatta Transport Ltd. shipping concern can&#x2019;t hold a candle to shipping out as an officer aboard an interstellar cruiser. It&#x2019;s adventure, not commerce, that stirs her soul. And despite her family&#x2019;s misgivings, there can be no doubt that a Vatta in the service will prove a valuable asset.

But keeping it simple has never been Ky&#x2019;s style. And even though her father has provided a crew of seasoned veterans to baby-sit the fledgling captain on her maiden milk run, they can&#x2019;t stop Ky from turning the routine mission into a risky venture&#x2013;in the name of turning a profit for Vatta Transport, of course.<br><br>By snapping up a lucrative delivery contract defaulted on by a rival company, and using part of the proceeds to upgrade her condemned vehicle, Ky aims to prove she&#x2019;s got more going for her than just her family&#x2019;s famous name. But business will soon have to take a backseat to bravery, when Ky&#x2019;s change of plans sails her and the crew straight into the middle of a colonial war. For all her commercial savvy, it&#x2019;s her military training and born-soldier&#x2019;s instincts that Ky will need to call on in the face of deadly combat, dangerous mercenaries, and violent mutiny. . . .</p><p><b>PRAISE FOR ELIZABETH MOON<br><br><i>HERIS SERRANO<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Dazzling . . .

Over time, however, the realities of American race relations begin to swamp their positive cultural values. Persistent, blatant racial discrimination soon undermines the openness to whites the immigrants have when they first arrive.

Low wages and poor working conditions are no longer attractive for their children, who use American and not Caribbean standards to measure success.</p><p>Ultimately, the values that gained these first-generation immigrants initial success--a willingness to work hard, a lack of attention to racism, a desire for education, an incentive to save--are undermined by the realities of life in the United States.

Contrary to long-held beliefs, Waters finds, those who resist Americanization are most likely to succeed economically, especially in the second generation.</p></p><p>New York City, the melting pot of the United States, contains the nation's largest West Indian immigrant population. Since the immigration explosion of 1965, the Afro-Caribbean influx has impacted the social dynamic of the United States and its native-born African Americans, often with volatile results. <i>Black Identities</i>, an important sociological work by Mary C. Waters, explores the question, "How similar or different is it to be a black immigrant or descendent of immigrants in Brooklyn in the late twentieth century from what it was like to be an Irish, Italian, or Jewish immigrant in the earlier part of the century?" Waters interviews blacks from Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad, and other islands and deconstructs the mutual myths, truths, allegiances, and distrusts between these communities and whites (as well as African Americans with deeper family roots in the U.S.). Among the stereotypes Waters addresses, the most dangerous one is the perceived superiority of Afro-Caribbeans to African Americans. She deflates this and other myths with a combination of sharp scholarship and dead-on analysis. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>West Indian immigration to the United States is considered a success story. Many of these adoptive citizens have prospered, most notably General Colin Powell. But in this book Mary Waters tells a very different story about immigrants from the West Indies, especially their children. She finds that when the immigrants first arrive, their knowledge of English, their skills and contacts, their self-respect, and their optimistic assessment of American race relations smooth their integration into the American economic structure. Over time, however, the realities of American race relations begin to swamp their positive cultural values. Persistent, blatant racial discrimination soon undermines their openness to whites. Discrimination in housing channels them into neighborhoods with inadequate city services and high crime rates. Inferior public schools frustrate their hopes for their children&#39;s future. Low wages and poor working conditions are not attractive to their children, who apply American and not Caribbean standards to measure success. Ultimately, the values that gained these first-generation immigrants their initial success -- willingness to work hard and to ignore racism, a desire for education, an incentive to save -- are undermined by their experience in the United States. In many families, the hard-won relative success of the parents is followed by the downward slide of their children. Contrary to long-held beliefs, Waters finds, those who resist Americanization are more likely to succeed economically, especially in the second generation.</p><h2>Was Jefferson Davis Right?</h2><p><p>Jefferson Davis, captured, imprisoned, and charged with 1) conspiracy and culpability in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; 2) conspiracy to cause the deaths of Northern P.O.W.'s at Andersonville, Georgia, a detention camp; 3) participating in and attempting to assist in the growth of the system of slavery; and 4) treason against the United States of America, was never afforded his constitutional right to a trial.</p></p><p><p>"Decisively refuting all the old slanders, the authors give us back the real Davis-a patriotic soldier, a reluctant secessionist, the model of a Christian gentleman, and an inspiration to all Americans, North and South."<br>-Chronicles: A Magazine of American Culture</p><p>"Was Jefferson Davis Right? is more than a biography of the Confederate president.

Joy is the spiritual dimension of happiness, in which one begins to understand one's intrinsic value and place in the universe. Accepting joy is a decision to "go with the flow," to be grateful to be alive and for all the challenges and opportunities in life, rather than setting conditions or demands for happiness.<br><br>The Insight for a New Way of Living series aims to shine light on beliefs and attitudes that prevent individuals from being their true selves. The text is an artful mix of compassion and humor, and readers are encouraged to confront what they would most like to avoid, which in turns provides the key to true insight and power.<br><br><i>Joy </i>is a wondrous investigation into the source and importance of joyfulness in our lives.<br></p><p>The works of Osho challenge readers to examine and break free of the conditions, belief systems, and prejudices that limit their capacity to experience life in all its richness. One of the best-known and most provocative spiritual teachers of the twentieth century, Osho has been described by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the "1,000 Makers of the twentieth century," and by the American novelist Tom Robbins as "the most dangerous man since Jesus Christ." More than a decade after his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to grow, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.<br>WHAT IS HAPPINESS? <p><br></p><p><i>Happiness has nothing to do with success, happiness has nothing to do with ambition, happiness has nothing to do with money, power, prestige. Happiness has something to do with your consiousness, not with your character.</i></p>IT DEPENDS ON YOU <p>What is happiness? It depends on you, on your state of consciousness or unconsciousness, whether you are asleep or awake. There is one famous maxim of Murphy. He says there are two types of people: one who always divides humanity into two types, and the other, who doesn&#x2019;t divide humanity at all. I belong to the first type: Humanity can be divided into two types, the sleeping ones and the awakened ones&#x2014;and, of course, a small group in between.</p><p>Happiness will depend on where you are in your consciousness. If you are asleep, then pleasure is happiness. Pleasure means sensation, trying to achieve something through the body that is not possible to achieve through the body&#x2014;forcing the body to achieve something it is not capable of. People are trying, in every possible way, to achieve happiness through the body.</p><p>The body can give you only momentary pleasures, and each pleasure is balanced by pain in the same amount, to the same degree. Each pleasure is followed by its opposite because the body exists in the world of duality. Just as the day is followed by night and death is followed by life and life is followed by death; it is a vicious circle. Your pleasure will be followed by pain, your pain will be followed by pleasure. But you will never be at ease. When you are in a state of pleasure you will be afraid that you are going to lose it, and that fear will poison it. And when you are lost in pain, of course, you will be in suffering and you will make every possible effort to get out of it&#x2014;only to fall back into it again.</p><p>Buddha calls this the wheel of birth and death. We go on moving with this wheel, clinging to the wheel ... and the wheel moves on. Sometimes pleasure comes up and sometimes pain comes up, but we are crushed between these two rocks.</p><p>But the sleeping person knows nothing else. He knows only a few sensations of the body&#x2014;food, sex; this is his world. He goes on moving between these two. These are the two ends of his body: food and sex. If he represses sex he becomes addicted to food; if he represses food he becomes addicted to sex. Energy goes on moving like a pendulum. And whatever you call pleasure is, at the most, just relief from a tense state.</p><p>Sexual energy gathers, accumulates; you become tense and heavy and you want to release it. To the man who is asleep, sexuality is nothing but a relief, like a good sneeze. It gives him nothing but a certain relief&#x2014;a tension was there, now it is no longer there. But it will accumulate again. Food gives you only a little taste on the tongue; it is not much to live for. But many people are living only to eat; there are very few people who eat to live.</p><p>The story of Columbus is well known. It was a long trip. For three months they saw nothing but water. Then one day Columbus looked out at the horizon and saw trees. And if you think Columbus was happy to see trees, you should have seen his dog!</p><p>This is the world of pleasure. The dog can be forgiven, but you cannot be forgiven.</p><p>During their first date, the young man, looking for ways to have a good time, asked the young lady if she would like to go bowling. She replied that she did not care to go bowling. He then suggested a movie, but she answered that she did not care for them. While trying to think of something else he offered her a cigarette, which she declined. He then asked if she would like to dance and drink at the new disco. She again declined by saying she did not care for those things.</p><p>In desperation he asked her to come to his apartment for a night of lovemaking. To his surprise she happily agreed, kissed him passionately, and said, &#x201c;You see, you don&#x2019;t need any of those other things to have a good time!&#x201d;</p><p>What we call &#x201c;happiness&#x201d; depends on the person. To the sleeping person, pleasurable sensations are happiness. The sleeping person lives from one pleasure to another pleasure. He is just rushing from one sensation to another sensation. He lives for small thrills; his life is very superficial. It has no depth, it has no quality. He lives in the world of quantity.</p><p>Then there are people who are in between, who are neither asleep nor awake, who are just in a limbo, a little bit asleep, a little bit awake. You sometimes have that experience in the early morning&#x2014;still sleepy, but you can&#x2019;t say you are asleep because you can hear the noise in the house, your partner preparing tea, the noise of the kettle or the children getting ready to go to school. You can hear these things, but still you are not awake. Vaguely, dimly, these noises reach you, as if there is a great distance between you and all that is happening around you. It feels as if it is still part of a dream. It is not part of a dream, but you are in a state of in-between.</p><p>The same happens when you start meditating. The nonmeditator sleeps, dreams; the meditator starts moving away from sleep toward awakening, is in a transitory state. Then happiness has a totally different meaning: It becomes more of a quality, less of a quantity; it is more psychological, less physiological. The meditator enjoys music more, enjoys poetry more, enjoys creating something. These people enjoy nature, its beauty. They enjoy silence, they enjoy what they had never enjoyed before, and this is far more lasting. Even if the music stops, something lingers on in you.</p><p>And it is not a relief. The difference between pleasure and this quality of happiness is that it is not a relief, it is an enrichment. You become more full, you start overflowing. While you listen to good music, something is triggered in your being, a harmony arises in you&#x2014;you become musical. Or dancing, suddenly you forget your body; your body becomes weightless. The grip of gravity over you is lost. Suddenly you are in a different space: The ego is not so solid, the dancer melts and merges into the dance.</p><p><br></p><p>Now is the only time and here is the only space. And then suddenly the whole sky drops into you. This is bliss. This is real happiness.</p><p>This is far higher, far deeper, than the pleasure you gain from food or sex. This has a depth. But this is also not the ultimate. The ultimate happens only when you are fully awake, when you are a buddha, when all sleep is gone and all dreaming is gone&#x2014;when your whole being is full of light, when there is no darkness within you. All darkness has disappeared and with that darkness, the ego is gone. All tensions have disappeared, all anguish, all anxiety. You are in a state of total contentment. You live in the present; no past, no future anymore. You are utterly here now. This moment is all. Now is the only time and here is the only space. And then suddenly the whole sky drops into you. This is bliss. This is real happiness.</p><p>Seek bliss; it is your birthright. Don&#x2019;t remain lost in the jungle of pleasures; rise a little higher. Reach to happiness and then to bliss. Pleasure is animal, happiness is human, bliss is divine. Pleasure binds you, it is a bondage, it chains you. Happiness gives you a little more rope, a little bit of freedom, but only a little bit. Bliss is absolute freedom. You start moving upward; it gives you wings. You are no longer part of the gross earth; you become part of the sky. You become light, you become joy.</p><p>Pleasure is dependent on others. Happiness is not so dependent on others, but still it is separate from you. Bliss is not dependent, it is not separate either; it is your very being, it is your very nature.</p>FROM THE SURFACE TO THE CENTER <p>Gautam Buddha has said: </p><p><i>There is pleasure and there is bliss.</i></p><p><i>Forgo the first to possess the second.</i></p><p>Meditate over it as deeply as possible, because it contains one of the most fundamental truths. These four words will have to be understood, pondered over: the first is pleasure; the second, happiness; the third is <i>joy;</i> and the fourth is <i>bliss.</i></p><p>Pleasure is physical, physiological. Pleasure is the most superficial thing in life; it is titillation. It can be sexual, it can be of other senses, it can become an obsession with food, but it is rooted in the body. The body is your periphery, your circumference; it is not your center. And to live on the circumference is to live at the mercy of all kinds of things that go on happening around you. The man who seeks pleasure remains at the mercy of accidents. It is like the waves in the ocean; they are at the mercy of the winds. When strong winds come, the waves are there; when the winds disappear, the waves disappear. They don&#x2019;t have an independent existence, they are dependent&#x2014;and anything that is dependent on something outside of itself brings bondage.</p><p>Pleasure is dependent on the other. If you love a woman, if that is your pleasure, then that woman becomes your master. If you love a man&#x2014;if that is your pleasure and you feel unhappy, in despair, sad, without him&#x2014;then you have created bondage for yourself. You have created a prison, you are no longer in freedom. If you are a seeker after money and power, then you will be dependent on money and power. The man who goes on accumulating money, if it is his pleasure to have more and more money, will become more and more miserable&#x2014;because the more he has, the more he wants, and the more he has, the more he is afraid to lose it.</p><p>It is a double-edged sword: wanting more is the first edge of the sword. The more you demand, the more you desire, the more you feel yourself lacking something&#x2014;the more hollow, empty, you appear to yourself. And the other edge of the sword is that the more you have, the more you are afraid it can be taken away. It can be stolen. The bank can fail, the political situation in the country can change, the country can go communist ... there are a thousand and one things upon which your money depends. Your money does not make you a master, it makes you a slave.</p><p>Pleasure is peripheral; hence it is bound to depend on outer circumstances. And it is only titillation. If food is pleasure, what actually is being enjoyed? Just the taste&#x2014;for a moment, when the food passes across the taste buds on your tongue, you feel a sensation that you interpret as pleasure. It is your interpretation. Today it may look like pleasure and tomorrow it may not look like pleasure; if you go on eating the same food every day your taste buds will become unresponsive to it. Soon you will be fed up with it.</p><p>That&#x2019;s how people become fed up&#x2014;one day you are running after a man or a woman and the next day you are trying to find an excuse to get rid of the same person. The same person&#x2014;nothing has changed! What has happened meanwhile? You are bored with the other, because the whole pleasure was in exploring the new. Now the other is no longer new; you are acquainted with their territory. You are acquainted with the body of the other, the curves of the body, the feel of the body. Now the mind is hankering for something new.</p><p>The mind is always hankering for something new. That&#x2019;s how the mind keeps you always tethered somewhere in the future. It keeps you hoping, but it never delivers the goods&#x2014;it cannot. It can only create new hopes, new desires.</p><p>Just as leaves grow on the trees, desires and hopes grow in the mind. You wanted a new house and now you have it&#x2014;and where is the pleasure? Just for a moment it was there, when you achieved your goal. Once you have achieved your goal, your mind is no longer interested in it; it has already started spinning new webs of desire. It has already started thinking of other, bigger houses. And this is so about everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is always hankering for something new. That&#x2019;s how the mind keeps you always tethered somewhere in the future. It keeps you hoping, but it never delivers the goods.</p><p>Pleasure keeps you in a neurotic state, restless, always in turmoil. So many desires, and every desire unquenchable, clamoring for attention. You remain a victim of a crowd of insane desires&#x2014;insane because they are unfulfillable&#x2014;and they go on dragging you in different directions. You become a contradiction. One desire takes you to the left, another toward the right, and simultaneously you go on nourishing both the desires. And then you feel a split, then you feel divided, you feel torn apart. Then you feel as if you are falling into pieces. Nobody else is responsible; it is the stupidity of desiring pleasure that creates this situation.</p><p>And it is a complex phenomenon. You are not the only one who is seeking pleasure; millions of people just like you are seeking the same pleasures. Hence there is great struggle, competition, violence, war. All have become enemies to each other because they are all seeking the same goal&#x2014;and not all of them can have it. Hence the struggle has to be total, you have to risk all&#x2014;and for nothing, because when you gain, you gain nothing. Your whole life is wasted in this struggle. A life that could have been a celebration becomes a long, drawn-out, unnecessary struggle.</p><p><br></p><p>People don&#x2019;t know much about Machiavelli, but they follow him&#x2014;as if Machiavelli is very close to their hearts. you need not read him, you are already following him.</p><p>When you are so wrapped up in seeking pleasure you cannot love, because the person who seeks pleasure uses the other as a means. And to use the other as a means is one of the most immoral acts possible, because each being is an end unto himself, you cannot use the other as a means. But in seeking pleasure you have to use the other as a means. You become cunning because it is such a struggle. If you are not cunning you will be deceived, and before others deceive you, you have to deceive them.</p><p>Machiavelli has advised pleasure seekers that the best way of defense is to attack. Never wait for the other to attack you; that may be too late. Before the other attacks you, you attack him! That is the best way of defense. And this is being followed, whether people know about Machiavelli or not.</p><p>This is something very strange: People know about Christ, about Buddha, about Mohammed, about Krishna, and nobody follows them. People don&#x2019;t know much about Machiavelli, but they follow him&#x2014;as if Machiavelli is very close to their hearts. You need not read him, you are already following him. Your whole society is based on Machiavellian principles; that&#x2019;s what the whole political game is all about. Before somebody snatches anything from you, snatch it from them; always be on guard. Naturally, if you are always on guard you will be tense, anxious, worried. Everyone is against you and you are against everybody else.</p><p>So pleasure is not and cannot be the goal of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Joy is spiritual. It is different, totally different from pleasure or happiness. It has nothing to do with the outside, with the other, it is an inner phenomenon.</p><p>The second word to be understood is happiness. Pleasure is physiological, happiness is psychological. Happiness is a little better, a little more refined, a little higher ... but not very much different from pleasure. You can say that pleasure is a lower kind of happiness and happiness is a higher kind of pleasure&#x2014;two sides of the same coin. Pleasure is a little primitive, animal; happiness is a little more cultured, a little more human&#x2014;but it is the same game played in the world of the mind. You are not so concerned with physiological sensations, you are much more concerned with psychological sensations. But basically they are not different.</p><p>The third is j...</p></p><h2>Photographer&#39;s Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX7</h2><p>The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 has earned a reputation as one of the first choices for photographers who want an advanced camera they can carry around with them to capture great images without the complication and weight of a DSLR or other large camera. With features such as a very fast lens with an aperture of f/1.4, excellent image quality, and a solid array of burst-shooting capabilities, this compact camera has attracted an enthusiastic following in the photography community. However, the camera does not come with a detailed printed manual for reference, making it difficult for users to find answers to questions about the use of the camera's many controls, menus, and features.<p> With the release of this guide book to the LX7, White Knight Press has provided users with a comprehensive guide to all operations of this sophisticated camera. Using a patient, tutorial-like approach, the book provides guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers not only about how to accomplish things with the LX7, but when and why to use the camera's many controls, menus options, and other features.</p><p> The book does not assume specialized knowledge by the reader as it explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, exposure compensation, white balance, and ISO sensitivity. The book also provides details about the camera's numerous menu options for playback, setup, and customizing the operation of the various buttons and other controls. </p><p>The book contains approximately 400 photographs, almost all in full color, which illustrate the LX7's controls, shooting screens, and menus. The photographs also provide examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Creative Control settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing and other aspects of images; the Scene shooting mode, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; the Photo Style menu option, which provides the ability to customize the appearance of images; and the camera's strong array of features for continuous shooting and shooting in dim lighting. </p><p>In addition, the book goes beyond the bounds of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, astrophotography, and macro photography.</p><p> The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the LX7, which can shoot high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which offers manual control of exposure and focus during movie recording. In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories available for the camera, including cases, external flash units, and filter adapters, and includes a list of web sites and other resources for further information. </p><p>Also, the book includes a detailed appendix with helpful Quick Tips that give particular insights into how to take advantage of the camera's features in the most efficient ways possible.</p></p><p>Alexander S.

During his lifetime he travelled all over the US as a salesman and taxi-driver, and his varied career included reporting and sports editing, acting as bodyguard to a politician, doubling for a wrestler, and writing for films and magazines. A founder of the celebrated Dallas Little Theatre, his novels include I Should Have Stayed Home (1938), Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (1948), and They Shoot Horses, Don&#39;t They? (1935), which was made into a film. He died in 1955.This once-famous noir novel (by the author of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) was originally published in 1948 and inspired an excellent (and long neglected) James Cagney film. In a grating and deliberately stiff style that reflects his arrogant egotism, college-educated ``Ralph Cotter'' (his alias) relates the story of his escape from a prison farm, involvement with willing and dangerous women, and complicity with a corrupt establishment dominated by crooked cops and lawyers that he thinks he can bend to his own invincible will. Cotter is a pugnacious, violently sensual Middle American Raskolnikov, and his remorseless amorality resonates as chillingly today as it must have 50 years ago. Aficionados of hard-boiled fiction who think that Hammett, Cain, and Jim Thompson set the standard ought to take a look at Horace McCoy. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But it can only be done when we are submissive to God's will and allow Him to build that church. In the pages of this far-sighted, uncompromising book, Bob Russell and his son Rusty share the ten principles upon which this remarkable church was founded. Throughout the book, you will see God's mighty power at work in a church that began in 1962 with only 50 members and has now grown to over 14,000 and has become a bustling "city on a hill" whose beaming faith powerfully impacts its community and the world. This book shares not only the story of one of the most amazing churches in America but also the story of what your church can become as you follow these ten time-tested principles and allow God to build your church.</p><p>God has blessed <b>Bob Russell</b> with a life much different than one he could have ever imagined.

W. "Butch" Dabney that afternoon in Cincinnati, Ohio, during a break at a conference on evangelism in 1965. "Hi, I'm Butch Dabney," he said. "I'm the chairman of the pulpit committee of a new church in Louisville, Kentucky, and I'd like to talk to you about our church. Do you have a minute?"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butch, who was then in his early forties, was personable, confident, relaxed, and quick-witted. And he had a contagious enthusiasm for the Lord and the new church he had helped start -- Southeast Christian Church in Louisville. Little did I know that I had just met a man who would become for me a spiritual mentor and lifelong friend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Southeast is going to be such a special church," Butch assured me. "We started just three years ago with fifty members from the South Louisville Christian Church. Among those members were several experienced and devoted leaders who really want the church to honor Christ and grow. Although we're currently meeting in the basement of a house, we've grown to 125 people and are in the process of building a new church building that will seat four hundred." Butch spoke with conviction and enthusiasm as he continued, "We believe that what we do for the Lord should be our very best. We also believe we have the potential to be a powerful church, and we've been praying for the right minister. That's where you come in."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at Southeast sounded ideal, but I knew what I had to say. "Your church sounds wonderful, and I'm sure it's going to do great things, but I know it can't be the Lord's will for me right now. In June, I became the first full-time minister of a congregation here in Ohio, and I committed to stay at least a year. It can't be God's will for me to break that promise." Butch and I parted company, and I didn't think I'd ever see him again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several months later I received a long-distance phone call. "Hi, I'm Butch Dabney. Remember me? I talked with you at the conference on evangelism several months ago. Well, we still haven't found a minister. Two women from our church came to hear you preach last Sunday and gave a glowing report. Sometime in the next few weeks, we'd like for you to come down and look over our situation. If it seems like a good fit, we'd be willing to wait until June when your year's commitment is up. Will you come?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I had a lot of apprehension about preaching in the suburbs of a large city, this was obviously an open door through which God was prodding me to walk. "Yes!" I said without hesitation. "I'll be happy to take a look."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I became a part of the ministry at Southeast in June of 1966, I was not quite twenty-three years old! But Butch Dabney assured me that the church was hungry to love a minister and poised to grow. He was right. The people were supportive and loving, and that's why I've been able to stay for thirty-four years. They endured some very immature sermons in those early years and helped me smooth out a lot of rough edges, and we grew together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>God Does Immeasurably More</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Southeast Christian Church was founded in 1962 when the leaders of its parent church (South Louisville Christian Church) felt the need to start a congregation on the growing eastern side of Louisville. After much prayer and planning, fifty people agreed to leave that established and growing congregation to start Southeast Christian Church.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday before the new congregation was to have its first service, Olin Hay, the minister at South Louisville, asked all those who were joining the new church to stand. When he looked out over the congregation, he was a little overwhelmed. He hadn't realized that so many were leaving. Among those who felt led to help start this new church were some of his most influential leaders. The fifty people included a worship leader, four elders, several deacons, and Butch Dabney -- Olin's own brother-in-law! But Olin bowed in prayer and asked God to bless this new congregation. And God began to bless it in an outstanding way.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1966, Southeast Christian Church has grown from 125 to over 13,500 in worship. We have gone through five building programs and two complete relocation projects, the last of which cost over ninety million dollars (including land, construction costs, and architects' fees). We have gone from an annual budget of eighteen thousand dollars to an annual budget of eighteen million dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many great joys and a few deep sorrows. Butch Dabney is now a retired elder, but he is still a mentor and friend to me. Our families are still close. He's like a father, and his sons are like brothers to me. And I have discovered that God's Word is true -- "God does immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Christmas Eve, 1998, Southeast moved into a new facility. We desperately needed the room to grow. Before the move we had been cramming ten thousand people into a twenty-two-hundred-seat auditorium in five weekend services. In several of those services, people had to sit in the aisles, and as many as five hundred people were worshiping in the fellowship hall, watching the service on closed-circuit television. We had parking and traffic problems. We were shuttling people from off-site parking locations and housing adult Bible fellowship classes in neighborhood schools. We were even dealing with space problems during the week, without adequate room to house all the Bible studies, training programs, support group meetings, and activities we wanted to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new facility includes a worship center that holds over nine thousand people, plenty of classroom space, an activities center, and two large fellowship halls. Attendance jumped by three thousand people in the first few weeks. We wondered if we would sustain that leap. Now, one year later, not only are we sustaining that growth, but we are also seeing many of those three thousand new people come forward to become a part of the church. When they come to shake my hand at the invitation time, I'll say, "How long have you been attending?" I am shocked at how many never attended our church before we moved into our new facility, which makes me all the more thankful that we chose to follow God's leading and build that new building.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was a student at Cincinnati Bible Seminary, I once visited a church that had five hundred people. I walked away saying, "That's just too big." I grew up attending a rural congregation in northwest Pennsylvania that until recent years never had more than one hundred members. I decided during my senior year of high school to enter the ministry, assuming I would return to that area of the country and help to pastor another small rural congregation. When people ask me today if I ever dreamed I'd be preaching to fourteen thousand people, I just laugh and say, "Not in my wildest imaginations." I often look around at what God is doing, consider my roots and my limitations, and say to myself, What in the world am I doing here? How did I get here? God must have a sense of humor!&nbsp;</p><p><b>Back to the Basics -- the Purpose of This Book</b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my favorite movies is Hoosiers, where Gene Hackman plays the part of Norman Dale, a former college coach with a tainted past who is hired to coach a rural high-school basketball team from Hickory, Indiana. Coach Dale leads the team all the way to the state finals. On the day of the semifinals, the team arrives at Butler Field House, the huge inner-city arena where they're to play in just a couple of hours. When the players enter the arena, their jaws fall slack and their eyes open wide. Gawking at the seats, the stand-alone goals, the suspended scoreboard, and the lights, they are awestruck and intimidated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Dale instructs one of his players to take a tape measure and determine the distance between the free-throw line and the goal. "What's the distance?" he asks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fifteen feet," the player says.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dale then tells the smallest player on the team to climb on the shoulders of a taller player so they can measure the goal. "How high is it?" he asks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten feet," the player says.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Dale says, "I believe you'll find these are the exact same measurements as our gym back in Hickory."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team members share in some nervous laughter, and everybody begins to relax. As they exit the gym, Coach Dale turns to his assistant and whispers, "Sure is big, isn't it!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what monumental challenges lie ahead in this new millennium. But I know we're still playing the same game. It's the same Bible we are teaching, the same truth we are proclaiming, the same Lord we are exalting. For the church to be the church -- in any&nbsp;</p><p>millennium -- we must follow certain principles. If we ignore even one of these essential principles, we'll become something other than a church, with no defining characteristic to separate us from a country club or civic organization.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm convinced that if your church is characterized by the ten principles outlined in this book, regardless of the methods you choose to implement them, God will bless your efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many church leaders go to conferences looking for a quick fix or easy solutions to their problems.

Star Trekï¿½: Terok Nor: Day of the Vipers <br><br>Prologue<p></p><br><br>The priest&#x2019;s hand rested on the small, carved handle that controlled the pitch of the window&#x2019;s nyawood shutters. A slight turn of the wrist would be all it required to close them firmly against the lessening day outside, but he hesitated, peering through the slits at the city streets ranged below. The smell of smoke was more pronounced now, and the faint acridity made his nostrils twitch. The scent was already in the room with him, different from the wisps that issued up from the cairn of glowing stones in the chamber&#x2019;s fire pit. Outside, the fires that raged were uncontrolled and full of lethality; in here, deep within the fusionstone halls of the Naghai Keep, he was safe.<br><br>The thought drew up the corners of his lips in a brief, bitter smile, his blandly handsome face turning away. Safe. The term was such a relative concept, a fragile construct stitched together by fearful men and women who marked out pieces of their world and declared them inviolate, as if they could wall off danger and forbid it to trespass. Gar Osen, vedek of the Prophets, could declare himself safe inside these walls, but he knew that the granite battlements and copper-studded gates were no more than paper to an aggressor who was determined to breach them. To think of oneself as safe from anything was foolish; a person could only truly exist in degrees of jeopardy, spending their life balancing the chances of death against moments of comparative peace. The bitter smile turned grim and stony.<br><br>Beneath the windows of the keep, far out past the ring wall and the ornamental public gardens beyond, into the city of Korto itself, Gar&#x2019;s gaze ranged over the shaded boulevards of the municipality. The fading day was prematurely dark with oily gray rain clouds rolling in from across the Sahving Valley, as if the weather itself were attempting to draw a veil over what was happening down on Korto&#x2019;s thoroughfares; but he had no doubts that the same sequence of events was taking place all over Bajor, in the cities of Ilvia, Jalanda, and Ashalla, across the spans of the planet from Musilla to Hedrikspool and every province in between.<br><br>He imagined he would see the same thing, hear the same sounds if he could stand at similar vantage points in those places. A woman&#x2019;s scream, sharp as the bark of a tyrfox; the long rumble of a building collapsing; air molecules shrieking as disruptors split them asunder; and the regular pulsing drum of gravity-resist motors. Gar saw a trio of shapes nosing slowly over the Edar Bridge, shield-shaped things that looked like legless beetles, shoving stalled skimmers out of their way with arcing force bumpers. Each had a spindly cannon on a pintle mount that tracked back and forth, tireless and robotic. For a moment, he wished for a monocular so that he might be able to get a better look at the armored vehicles, but there was little need. The priest knew exactly what they were.<br><br>If he looked hard enough, he could just about make out the insignia painted on the sloping, gunmetal-colored hulls: a scythe-edged fan, something like a spread flower. The sigil, just like the grav-tanks and the beings that crewed them, was unlike anything native to Bajor. And yet they moved, not with the wary pace of new invaders, but with the arrogant and stately menace of an occupying army. Gar had only to watch them, and now the lines of figures in black battle armor coming up behind the tanks, to know that the Bajorans had already lost. The arrival had come, silent and steady as the sunrise, and Bajor had been looking the other way.<br><br>The more Gar looked, the more he saw. Black-suited shapes here and there, in the marketplace and the City Oval. The blink of beam fire, followed seconds later by the noise of it reaching him high in the keep. He wondered idly where the citadel&#x2019;s defenders had gone. Were they still up above him on the ramparts, peering through their rifle scopes at the same sights, too afraid to do anything, too surprised to discover they were no longer safe? Or perhaps they had run, fled to the hills or back to their families in the low-caste quarters of the city. The priest doubted that anyone had been able to escape. Nothing but smoke was in the air now, and he hadn&#x2019;t seen anything lift off from the riverside port since the morning&#x2014;and even that craft had been so small and so fast, it was impossible to know its design and origin.<br><br>He thought he heard a clattering from the gates, but Gar&#x2019;s chamber was on the far side of the keep from the main portcullis and the wind rose and fell, bringing only snatches of sound to his ears. Not for the first time that day, his thoughts drifted to the desk in the middle of the room where his effects lay in untidy profusion. Beside an open copy of Yalar&#x2019;s New Insights was a cloth bundle concealing a narrow-bore phaser pistol. There was plenty of room inside the vedek&#x2019;s voluminous robes to conceal the gun, but then what would that benefit him? To be an armed priest on today of all days&#x2014;it invited trouble. And besides, he was quite capable of killing with his bare hands, if the matter pressed him to it. He looked down at his spread palms, at the thin and lightly tanned skin, the lengthy artisan&#x2019;s fingers. There was a moment of disconnection, as if the hands belonged to someone else.<br><br>Gar heard sounds out in the corridor beyond and the thread of his reverie snapped. Swift, frightened footfalls stumbled along the wooden floors, getting closer by the second. The vedek stepped to the table and laid a hand on the phaser, those long fingers slipping into the cloth to wrap around the weapon&#x2019;s knurled grip.<br><br>A hard report sounded on the chamber door. He could hear someone gasping in deep breaths on the other side. &#x201c;Gar! Gar!&#x201d; The words were high with effort and terror. &#x201c;Are you in there? For Fate&#x2019;s sake, open the door!&#x201d;<br><br>Gar knew the voice, and he schooled his face in the moment before he released the latch.<br><br>A hooded figure in pastel-colored robes fell in through the door and slammed it shut behind. The hood fell back to reveal slick, jet-black hair framing a pale gray face lined in ropelike ridges, sunken blue eyes darting back and forth across the chamber. The Cardassian held a leather carryall clutched to his chest, knuckles white where they held on to the strap with wild determination. He blinked and swallowed hard. &#x201c;Brother,&#x201d; he began breathlessly, &#x201c;you have no idea how glad I am to see you! I didn&#x2019;t dare to hope that you would still be here.&#x201d;<br><br>Gar opened his hands. &#x201c;Where else would I be, Bennek, if not here? In times of crisis, the Prophets would not have us flee and leave our kindred alone.&#x201d;<br><br>Bennek hesitated at those words, as if he sensed something of an admonition in them. He worked visibly to calm himself and placed the bag upon the table, taking an empty seat. Gar offered him a flask of water, and the Cardassian drank greedily.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; Gar asked carefully. &#x201c;You must know the keep won&#x2019;t offer you any sanctuary.&#x201d;<br><br>Bennek&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;You would turn me out?&#x201d;<br><br>Gar shook his head. &#x201c;I mean that this place won&#x2019;t protect you.&#x201d;<br><br>The other man sagged in the chair. &#x201c;I...I know that. They&#x2019;re out there, sweeping the streets with bio-scanners. Looking for Cardassian life signs.&#x201d; He nodded bleakly. &#x201c;Yes. They&#x2019;ll find me soon enough. It&#x2019;s inevitable.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The others?&#x201d; The vedek eyed the bag, wondering about its contents.<br><br>&#x201c;Gone,&#x201d; Bennek said in a dead voice. &#x201c;Scattered, murdered...I pray to Oralius that it is not so, but I have only seen bodies.&#x201d; He grabbed at Gar&#x2019;s wrist in sudden panic.<br><br>&#x201c;What if...what if I am the only one left? What if I am the last to walk the Way?&#x201d;<br><br>Gently, the vedek peeled Bennek&#x2019;s fingers from his arm and pushed him away. &#x201c;My friend,&#x201d; he said quietly, &#x201c;I can only imagine what horrors you are facing at this moment, and I pray for you. I know the Prophets and your Oralius will watch over you. You must be strong, Bennek, for if indeed you are the last of your faith, then you alone must rise to bear the weight of it.&#x201d;<br><br>The Cardassian looked away. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I can.&#x201d; He choked off a sob. &#x201c;I...Tima, she...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Strength, Bennek,&#x201d; repeated Gar. &#x201c;The time for more mortal concerns will come later.&#x201d; He glanced at the window. The thrumming of the tanks was closer. &#x201c;But for now, you should get away. Go to ground.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you hide me?&#x201d; The words were plaintive, like a child&#x2019;s. This Bennek was a far cry from the one who had first arrived on Bajor so many years earlier, full of purpose and brimming with unshakable belief. All that had been slowly beaten from him, flensed away over time until he was little more than the pale echo sitting before Gar. These past days, the events unfolding across Bajor, Osen saw now how they were the last turns of the screw, the final pressures that broke the Cardassian priest&#x2019;s will. &#x201c;Please?&#x201d; Bennek asked.<br><br>Gar shook his head. &#x201c;You ask too much, Bennek. You&#x2019;ve been out on the streets, you&#x2019;ve seen what is happening in Korto. If they find you here, they&#x2019;ll burn the keep to the ground, and everyone in it. Would you want that?&#x201d; He advanced a step. &#x201c;Would Tima want that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Bennek said quietly, and then with more conviction, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; A measure of his former strength returned to the Cardassian. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, of course. Forgive me for my weakness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure even Oralius knows that no man can be strong every day.&#x201d;<br><br>Bennek nodded. &#x201c;But now I have to be.&#x201d; He opened the bag and removed an object hastily wrapped in a torn and scorched strip of prayer tapestry. Gar recognized the tightly lined forms of Hebitian script across the blackened cloth. Bennek unrolled the tapestry and revealed an ornate mask carved from milky gray wood. The features of it were unquestionably Cardassian, but strangely fluid as well, and bore odd striations that some observers might think mimicked the nasal ridges of a native Bajoran. Something about the mask unsettled the vedek, but he was careful not to let that emotion show on his face.<br><br>Bennek let out a small cry of despair as he took up the mask and a part of it came away in his hands, a piece from the orbit of the right eye, whorled with delicately worked filigree in latinum and jevonite. &#x201c;It must have been damaged when I ran from the encampment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a small impairment.&#x201d; Gar appraised the mask.<br><br>&#x201c;This is an impressive relic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is one of the original Faces of the Fates, from the time of the First Hebitians on Cardassia,&#x201d; said the other priest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve kept it safe for years...&#x201d; He blinked, shaking away a moment of distraction. Placing the mask on the table, Bennek delved into the bag again and brought out a nested set of tubes made from murky glass. More etchings in the careful Hebitian script covered the exterior. &#x201c;The Recitations,&#x201d; explained the Cardassian. &#x201c;This is one of only a few complete copies of the Word of my faith. This, my Bajoran brother, is the holy text of the Oralian Way in its entirety.&#x201d; Bennek&#x2019;s hands were shaking as he touched it.<br><br>Gar was no stranger to the religion, having seen Bennek and the members of his congregation perform their rites on many occasions. They would don the masks, ceremonially assuming the role as the avatar of their god, before speaking the lessons of Oralius as read from their sacred scrolls. The vedek assumed that somewhere there had to be definitive originals of the text, but he had never dared to imagine that one of them might be here, on Bajor. Bennek&#x2019;s breathless awe in the face of these two objects was ample illustration of the incalculable value the Oralians placed on them. &#x201c;Why do you show me these things?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>The Cardassian was on his feet, nodding to himself. &#x201c;You cannot hide me, I was wrong to ask it of you. I will leave this place, but in the name of our twin faiths, I ask you to do this for me, Osen.&#x201d; He pointed at the relics. &#x201c;Conceal them. Hide the mask and the scrolls from the soldiers and promise me you will never reveal their location as long as you live, not until the soul of Cardassia grows strong again, not until the Voice of Oralius is ready to be heard once more. Tell me you will do this.&#x201d; Bennek thrust the scrolls into Gar&#x2019;s hands, and the vedek rocked back. &#x201c;Swear it!&#x201d;<br><br>There were more footsteps out in the corridor: the heavy thud of armored boots matched with the splintering of doors being kicked open. Gar heard gruff voices shouting and calling out commands to one another.<br><br>Bennek&#x2019;s eyes were pleading, shining with fear. &#x201c;In the name of your Prophets,&#x201d; he cried, &#x201c;swear it!&#x201d;</p><h2>The Quest</h2><p>A stunning, heart-pounding, journey into the lost world of the Pharaohs. Wilbur Smith has earned international acclaim for his bestselling River God, The Seventh Scroll, and Warlock. Now, the unrivalled master of adventure returns with the eagerly awaited sequel to his thrilling Egyptian series with his most fantastic story yet. The Quest continues the story of the Warlock, Taita, wise in the lore of the gods and a master of magic and the supernatural. Egypt has been struck by a series of terrible plagues, killing its crops and crippling its people. Then the ultimate disaster befalls the kingdom. The Nile fails. The waters that nourish and sustain the land dry up. Something catastrophic is taking place in the distant and totally unexplored depths of Africa, from where the mighty river springs. In desperation the Pharaoh sends Taita, the only man who might be able to find his way through the hazardous territory to the source of the Nile and discover the cause of all their woes. But not even Taita can have any idea of what a terrible enemy waits in ambush in those dark lands at the end of their world. No other author can conjure up the violence and mystery of Ancient Egypt like Wilbur Smith. The Quest marks his stirring return to the acclaimed series and proves once again why fans such as Stephen King praise him as the world&#39;s &#34;best historical novelist.&#34;</p><p><p><b>Praise for author Wilbur Smith</b></p><p>"Smith is a master." <i>&#x2015;Publishers Weekly</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"One of the world's most popular adventure writers." <i>&#x2015;The Washington Post Book World</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"A rare author who wields a razor-sharp sword of craftsmanship." <i>&#x2015;Tulsa World</i></p><p>"Wilbur Smith is one of those benchmarks against whom others are compared." <i>&#x2015;The Times</i> (UK) <br>"Best Historical Novelist--I say Wilbur Smith, with his swashbuckling novels of Africa.

He worried constantly about his job, his finances, and his family. It was a chance invitation to India, the land of his birth, that finally freed him. <br><br> India, Miglani writes, is &#x201c;the capital of chaos&#x201d;: over a billion people living on one-third the space of the United States. And it was there that he learned to let go. The secret is to stop trying to control the chaos and focus on what you can control&#x2014;your own actions, words, and thoughts. Move forward, make mistakes, trust your intuition, find your purpose.<br><br> In this inspiring book, Miglani shares the experiences and encounters that helped him finally get it. What happens when you find yourself in an Indian village with no money and a plane to catch? How could an educated urban woman agree to a marriage after two dates? What keeps a rural health worker motivated despite the enormous need and such limited ability to help? What does trying to catch an insanely overcrowded bus teach you about perfection?

Did you know that whatever you don&#39;ï¿½?t digest becomes a toxin in your body? Enzymes, the little known but powerful nutritional marvels of nature, are the most overlooked link to good health. In over 60 documented case studies, THE ENZYME CURE shows how enzyme therapy can rebalance hormones, restore health, and prevent illness.Leading researcher Lita Lee, Ph.D., gives you the complete low-cost, self-help program for using plant enzymes to reverse 36 major health conditions. Dr. Lee has over 30 years&#39;ï¿½? experience in chemical and medical research. Her 14-year enzyme therapy practice specializes in developing nutritional protocols for balancing body chemistry, with a focus on enzyme therapy, hormonal balancing, and protection from environmental toxins.For more information visit the Alternative Medicine website.</p><p>BURTON GOLDBERG is the founder of Alternative Medicine magazine, the leading consumer publication in the field. He lives in Tiburon, California.<p><strong>You Don&#x2019;t Have to Take Drugs</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>America has created a multibillion dollar synthetic drug market. In 1997 alone, American women bought 33.1 million prescriptions of Premarin (a synthetic estrogen derived from the urine of pregnant horses), making it the nation&#x2019;s best-selling drug. Yet, this estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) may actually be harming the health of the women who take it. Often, too much estrogen in relation to progesterone causes hormonal havoc and leads to symptoms from bloating and headache to major health problems such as gallbladder disease and cancer.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical companies, however, simply come up with another drug to treat the symptoms the original drug produced. The second drug then creates its own side effects, and so on. In the end, we have come to accept what conventional medicine tells us: We need drugs to control our body functions. We even take drugs to destroy cholesterol, which is necessary for the production of essential anti-aging hormones. At the same time, these cholesterol-lowering drugs let loose toxic side effects, which can result in liver problems, depression, immune system dysfunction, and, once again, cancer.</p> <p>There is, however, an escape from this destructive cycle of drug-taking. That escape is alternative medicine. Instead of treating symptoms with synthetic drugs, alternative medicine goes to the root causes and uses safe, noninvasive methods to address and reverse these causes.</p> <p>One such natural alternative is enzyme therapy. In this book, Lita Lee, Ph.D., one of the nation&#x2019;s leading enzyme therapists, shows you how to treat 36 health problems without using synthetic drugs. Here, you will read about desperate people who consulted Dr. Lee after going through countless drugs and a lot of money. They came to her not only with their original symptoms, but often with damage from the drugs they had taken, and she put them back on the path to good health.</p> <p>Unlike conventional medical practitioners, Dr. Lee does not search for a single cause behind a health problem. Nor does she believe in giving vitamins and supplements to a patient without first addressing the digestive dysfunction which often accompanies chronic illness. For her, that would be like throwing money out the window. Instead, Dr. Lee looks at the whole person. Before she begins any treatment, she gets a complete picture of the individual&#x2019;s symptoms, health history, diet, and possible digestive problems and hormonal imbalances. She then designs a treatment plan tailored to that individual, using a combination of enzyme therapy, dietary recommendations, and thyroid and other hormonal balancing, as appropriate.</p> <p>This book gives you detailed accounts of over 60 people whose health problems were successfully reversed through these therapies. Dr. Lee&#x2019;s advice is simple: You don&#x2019;t have to take drugs to get well. By treating the underlying causes of your health condition&#x2015;whether asthma or insomnia&#x2015;you will improve your overall health, and leave the drugs behind.

The Loire River itself is the longest in France and passes through a succession of landscapes, many of them of a richness that proves this is truly "the garden of France." And there is variety too, reflected in the buildings and settings of the beautiful villages so stunningly illustrated in this book. Traveling west, James Bentley and Hugh Palmer take us first to the communities around Orleans, the villages of the Loiret and Cher departements. We then progress to the lands around Blois and Tours, where, it is said, the purest French is spoken. Here begin the villages with the great chatea ux, such as Chambord, Cheverny, and Azay-le-Rideau, reached by long roads lined with poplars or lying beside the banks of one of the many tributaries of the Loire. The slopes here are frequently vine-clad, producing the delicious white wines that make such a fine accompaniment to the traditional fish cuisine of the region. And finally we arrive at the villages around Angers and Nantes where willow-lined rivers divide a landscape of quiet opulence, and green fields alternate with market gardens growing vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Over thirty villages of the Loire valley are described and beautifully photographed in this book, which is completed by special sections on wine and food and abbeys and churches. As with all the volumes in <i>The Most Beautiful Villages</i> series, there are appendices listing the most important sites, markets, hotels, and restaurants. 275 color illustrations.</p><p><b>Hugh Palmer</b> is one of Britain&#x2019;s leading photographers of architecture and gardens.

Bodie's goal seemed impossible, however, when midway through grade school it was discovered that she had dyslexia, a learning disability that made it difficult for her to read. Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life. Reading opened the world to me. I began to write stories of my own." </p> <p>By the young age of fourteen, Bodie had a job as a stringer reporter for The California Newspaper. "They paid me fifty cents an inch for one article a week. The most I ever made was twelve dollars, but I felt rich!"</p> <p>Bodie continued her college education as a Journalism-Political Science major in San Jose, California. She covered the Bay-area political unrest of the Vietnam era as an associate for <i>U.S. News and World Report.</i> Her career as a journalist seemed assured, but she says, "I thought to myself that there has to be more to life than writing about riots and peace marches."</p> <p>Bodie married Brock Thoene during their sophomore year in college. They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys. The birth of their first child did not stop her from writing. "I held her with one arm and typed with the other!"</p> <p>Publication of <i>The Fall Guy</i> catapulted Bodie into national attention and acclaim. Shortly after that she went to work for John Wayne's Batjac Productions and ABC Television as a writer and researcher, working with the top writers in the motion picture industry. Among those who work with her, she is known as one of the finest character and action writers in the business. Her work is currently featured in <i>American West, Saturday Evening Post, </i>and <i>Smithsonian </i>magazine, as well as other national publications. </p> <p>Bodie's interest in Israel, which culminated in THE ZION CHRONICLES, stems from her days as a student. In 1978 she spoke to John Wayne about her hope to one day write a novel about the exciting events surrounding the rebirth of Israel. He encouraged her with his reply: "That's one you ought to do.

Because of these activities, she was deported to Russia in 1919, where she was able to witness the Revolution's aftermath firsthand. Horrified by what she saw in major cities and revolted by the Bolshevik dictatorship, she left the country in 1921 and, soon after, set down her thoughts in two books &#x2014; <i>My Disillusionment in Russia</i> and <i>My Further Disillusionment in Russia.</i> She wrote passionately about political harassment and forced labor inflicted upon the masses, rampant opportunism raging throughout the Soviet government, industrial militarization, persecution of anarchists, and the government's increased use of deportation as a political weapon. Her writings helped turn a large number of socialists against the Bolshevik government. Her two books have been combined in this Dover edition &#x2014; a volume that will be of value to teachers, students, and anyone interested in the socio-economic problems of the early 20th century.</p><p>Emma Goldman (1869 &#x2013; 1940) was an anarchist known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. Born in Kovno in the Russian Empire (now Kaunas in Lithuania), Goldman emigrated to the US in 1885 and lived in New York City, where she joined the burgeoning anarchist movement. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Though Frick survived the attempt on his life, Berkman was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal Mother Earth. In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to "induce persons not to register" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested&#x2014;along with hundreds of others&#x2014;and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Goldman quickly voiced her opposition to the Soviet use of violence and the repression of independent voices. In 1923, she wrote a book about her experiences, My Disillusionment in Russia. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called Living My Life. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto on May 14, 1940. During her life, Goldman was lionized as a free-thinking "rebel woman" by admirers, and derided by critics as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman's iconic status was revived in the 1970s, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest in her life.</p><h2>A Tuscan in the Kitchen: Recipes and Tales from My Home</h2><p>This exuberant, delightfully unconventional cookbook is a warm, personal collection of recipes and reminiscences of the author's native Tuscany and a guide to a spontaneous way of cooking based on good taste and common sense rather than rigid rules.<br><br>In A Tuscan in the Kitchen, Pino Luongo, the creator of New York's successful Il Cantinori restaurant, presents 140 of his favorite recipes, from soups and antipasti to salads and desserts. The recipes include such tempting dishes as trout with balsamic vinegar, peasant-style risotto made with sausage and peas, roasted quail with tarragon, spaghetti with sea bass sauce, radicchio and orange salad, and baked peaches stuffed with walnuts and chocolate. Interspersed throughout in a spirited narrative are tales of his adventures as well as stories of family celebrations and the local traditions of the people who live in Tuscany's dries, hill towns, and fishing ports.<br><br>Mr. Luongo shows us how to cook the Tuscan way, using a small repertoire of ingredients and a few basic techniques to create dishes that taste delicious and can be endlessly varied. The ingredients in each recipe are broken down into a three-part list: pantry staples, like olive oil, pasta, and canned plum tomatoes; cold storage items such as eggs, butter, and cheese; and a handful of market foods that need to be purchased fresh. In the recipes, he gives basic instructions and guidelines for making each dish but does not give exact quantities. For instance, a recipe for tagliatelle with fresh garden vegetables suggests a variety of vegetables and herbs; the cook decides how many and how much of each to use, according to taste. Mr. Luongo teaches us the kind of flexibility good cookshave always practiced and encourages us to create our own personal style of cooking -- and have a wonderful time in the kitchen, too.<br><br>Filled with warmth and an irrepressible enthusiasm for life's pleasures, A Tuscan in the Kitchen is an original and inspiring cookbook.</p><p>Italian food has never been more popular, and now, in this inspiring cookbook, Pino Luongo presents the food of his native Tuscany. With him as our guide, we discover the delights of the region and learn a relaxed and simple way of cooking without precise measurements. As he says in the introduction, "Most cookbooks give exact amounts of this and that, but I never learned about timing and quantities -- I did everything by instinct. If you make a mistake in tablespoons, it's not going to hurt you. You don't need a prescription for cooking food, you're the person in charge...As in love, there are no rules for cooking. Everything should be done with feeling."<p>It's one of the loveliest cookbooks I've ever seen, filled with spectacular pictures, great stories and recipes that sound wonderful. -- Los Angeles Times</p><p>Even if one never makes a single recipe, his book, with its wit and wit and breezy style, is fun to read.</p><p>-- Milwaukee Journal</p><p>Its recipes are direct and appealing, the accompanying narrative charming and the many culinary opinions well worth considering.</p><p>-- Washington Post Book World</p><p>Anyone who likes to cook and is relaxed about it should find the book rewarding. -- New York Times</p>Pino Luongo was born in Florence, Italy.

First published in German in 1977, it has now been translated into English with the assistance of the author himself. A clearly structured and readable survey for students and scholars, it will be welcomed as the best modern account of any polytheistic religious system. </p><p> Burkert draws on archaeological discoveries, insights from other disciplines, and inscriptions in Linear B to reconstruct the practices and beliefs of the Minoan-Mycenaean age. The major part of his book is devoted to the archaic and classical epochs. He describes the various rituals of sacrifice and libation and explains Greek beliefs about purification. He investigates the inspiration behind the great temples at Olympia, Delphi, Delos, and the Acropolis - discussing the priesthood, sanctuary, and oracles. Considerable attention is given to the individual gods, the position of the heroes, and beliefs about the afterlife. The different festivals are used to illuminate the place of religion in the society of the city-state. The mystery cults, at Eleusis and among the followers of Bacchus and Orpheus, are also set in that context. The book concludes with an assessment of the great classical philosophers' attitudes to religion. </p><p> Insofar as possible, Burkert lets the evidence -- from literature and legend, vase paintings and archaeology -- speak for itself; he elucidates the controversies surrounding its interpretation without glossing over the enigmas that remain. Throughout, the notes (updated for the English-language edition) afford a wealth of further references as the text builds up its coherent picture of what is known of the religion of ancient Greece. </p></p><p>This is the first major synthesis of Greek religion to appear for a generation. A clearly structured and readable survey for classical scholars and students, it will also be generally welcomed as the best modern account of any polytheistic religious system. The text builds up an impressive and coherent picture of the current state of knowledge about the religion of the ancient Greeks.<b>Walter Burkert</b> is Professor Emeritus of Classics, University of Zurich.</p><h2>Doc McStuffins Time for Your Checkup!</h2><p>Young fans are invited to assist Doc&#39;s efforts to help toys with their boo-boos and ouchies by opening dozens of interactive flaps that reveal the tools she needs for checkups.

She traces its migration from India and/or China to Persia and Europe via the Islamic world, noting how the design of the pieces was influenced by each culture. Polytheistic India created floridly representational figures, while Islamic disapproval of the human image resulted in the sculpting of more abstract pieces. In this contextual vein, Schafroth's pictured sets include a Soviet porcelain ensemble pitting capitalists against proletarians, and many modeled on medieval society's knights, bishops, and peons. The craftsmanship of these sets is another focus of the album: carved from bone, ivory, and crystal, chess sets were menageries of statuary for the kings who ordered them. As the game gained in popularity, the design of its pieces became more functional: the Staunton design, with its iconic horse head for the knight, dates from the mid-1800s. The handsome photographs in Schafroth's showcase will hold chess lovers rapt. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Stunningly intricate chess pieces from as early as the 10th century are on display in The Art of Chess, Maryhill Museum of Art director Colleen Schafroth's beautifully illustrated homage to one of the world's oldest and most popular pastimes. Schafroth traces the evolution of the game from its origins in India, to its first golden age under the Arab caliphate, to the birth of the (much faster) modern version in 15th-century Europe. Photos of chessmen from around the world include an ivory Inuit set featuring igloos and seals, and a Soviet version that pits capitalists (and their enchained pawns) against the vigorous country lads who represent the Soviets. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Romola (Penguin English Library)</h2><p>Innocent Romola&#39;s life is shaped by her love for a man whose selfishness leads him to evil deeds</p><p>&#39;There is no book of mine about which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood.&#39;. So wrote George Eliot of Romola, the novel which argues her most profound and utopian vision of the position of women. Romola&#39;s patient subservience to her scholar-father Bardo, her unhappy marriage to supple and treacherous Tito, and her passionate intellectual and spiritual awakening take place in Renaissance Florence which, like Victorian Britain, was caught up in a period of ferment and transition. Romola appeared in 1862-3 to high praise by Victorians from Tennyson and Trollope to Henry James, and discerning modern readers will recognize it as George Eliot&#39;s first mature masterpiece. In her introduction to this new edition, Dorothea Barrett explores the issues of gender and learning, desire and scholarship, and the interweaving of history and fiction which she identifies at the centre of the novel.George Eliot&#39;s Romola, writes Robert Kiely in his Introduction, embodies the author&#39;s &#34;wrestling with her own best theories of history and human nature as a creative experiment of the highest order.&#34; Set in Florence in 1492, a time of great political and religious turmoil, Eliot&#39;s novel blends vivid fictional characters with historical figures such as Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medicis. When Romola, the virtuous daughter of a blind scholar, marries Tito Melema, a charismatic young Greek, she is bound to a man whose escalating betrayals threaten to destroy all that she holds dear. Profoundly inspired by Savonarola&#39;s teachings, then crushed by the religious leader&#39;s ultimate failure, Romola finds her salvation in noble self-sacrifice. This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the 1878 Cabinet Edition.</p><h2>Unfolding Message of the Bible</h2><p>In most of his books, Dr. Morgan is a teacher and the reader a student; in this book, the scene and the relationship are different. This is a fireside chat, and the most informal of all his writings. It is as though the reader were invited into the home of the renowned and beloved scholar to sit before the fire and just talk about the Scriptures. It is as intimate as that. Here is completely new and previously unpublished material, and a new look at the warm and glowing personality of this master of the Word. Originally, he called it &#x201c;The Harmony of the Scriptures,&#x201d; but we felt that such a title might indicate that it was another of those &#x201c;Harmonies&#x201d; which run the Gospels in parallel columns, for the purposes of comparison. This is not a comparison, but a weaving together. The Bible is indeed a library of sixty-six books, each of which must be studied separately if we are to understand it. But we must also understand that the books are chapters in a long, connected story &#x2013; the story of a community, and a record of divine government &#x2013; and that, as Dr. Morgan has it, &#x201c;It is concerning... Christ, and the history of that Lord, that the Bible is one.&#x201d; This is the divine, interwoven tapestry of the Word, as God gave it warp and woof, described by one who sees the golden thread of one increasing purpose and unfolding message running through it all. It is G. Campbell Morgan at his informal and inspiring best.

Alfred Taubman, the shopping-mall king who bought Sotheby's in 1983 to keep it from falling into the hands of a couple of carpet salesmen, became the only principal in the case to actually do jail time-apparently due to what some courtroom observers labeled "the worst defense money can buy." It didn't help that Diana "DeDe" Brooks, who started her career as an unpaid intern and whose workaholic habits persuaded Taubman to make her Sotheby's CEO, became one of the government's chief witnesses against Taubman. On the Christie's side, the lineup features a number of snobbish Brits, including Christie's CEO, Christopher Davidge, who seems to have sold everyone else down the river. It would have made for smoother reading if Mason (or his editor) had done some pruning: how many times do we need to be told that Brooks is six feet tall or that Taubman's wife, Judy, is a glamorous former beauty queen? But in the end, it's the story that carries the day-an amazing and depressing chronicle of greed in the name of culture that should (but probably won't) keep art buyers from ever walking into an auction house again. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As his friends look on, they watch something awful unfold: Otto lands with an odd smack and knocks himself unconscious, blood spilling from his nose and mouth. Georgie arrives on the scene first and sees a small turtle, its shell cracked, floating just below the water's surface.<br> Otto and the turtle survive the collision, though both need help, and Georgie finds his compassions torn. This title story sets the tone for the rest of Arthur Bradford's <i>Turtleface and Beyond</i>, a strangely funny collection featuring prosthetically limbed lovers, a snakebitten hitchhiker turned wedding crasher, a lawyer at the end of his rope, a mï¿½nage ï¿½ trois at Thailand's Resort Tik Tok, and a whole host of near disasters, narrow escapes, and complicated victories, all narrated by Georgie, who struggles with his poor decisions but finds redemption in the telling of each of his tales.

He&#x2019;d been admitted a week ago, transferred from police to orderlies while dozens of reporters swarmed the entrance, overwhelming security in their struggle to get a clear shot of our newest, involuntary patient. Inside, he&#x2019;d put up such a fight that three men had to hold him down while they administered sedatives and brought him straight into isolation. The boy who came back from the dead, the newscasters called him. The picture they flashed, the only one they&#x2019;d gotten before he&#x2019;d become a violent blur, showed a sunburned, lean face and dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. His eyes were a ghostly blue, the kind of eyes songs get written about.<br> <br>Ward four wasn&#x2019;t on my rotation so I didn&#x2019;t see him after that, but I heard about him everywhere. Cashiers at the gas station chewed on their theories. Newspaper editorialists speculated on worst case scenarios, calling him a savage and a murderer. The fascination bled into the Internet, where social media accounts popped up overnight. A fake Twitter handle had already gotten ten thousand followers, someone on Snapchat made him a Bitmoji avatar, and countless people on Facebook filled his timeline with unanswered questions. The entire city of Duluth was obsessed with him; I could practically feel thousands of eyes gazing up the hill toward Congdon Psychiatric Facility, trying to peer inside these old, brick walls.<br> <br>A few days after his admission Dr. Mehta called me into her office. I was the assistant speech therapist on staff, my shiny, new title after earning my graduate degree from the University of Minnesota and getting promoted from orderly. It still hadn&#x2019;t sunk in, even five months later. Every time I put a note on a patient&#x2019;s record, my signature line popped up, startling me, like I was impersonating someone whose comments mattered. Me, Maya Stark, the recalcitrant kid who was suspended from high school, a professional therapist? I looked like I belonged on the opposite side of the couch. I was the maroon-haired punk girl who ran her German shepherd along the lake walk, making all the tourists snatch their kids out of harm&#x2019;s way. Yet here I was. Twenty-three years old and called in by the head psychiatrist to work with the most famous patient we&#x2019;d ever had.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell if he understands us or not,&#x201d; Dr. Mehta said, pacing behind her desk in a swirl of sari fabric. For a shrink, she rarely sat down. She also lint-rolled herself a lot because her wife fostered cats, like an illegal amount of them. &#x201c;Understands the diction, that is. He knows perfectly well we&#x2019;re trying to communicate with him and he wants nothing to do with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dr. Mehta was young, at least for being the senior psychiatrist in charge of an entire mental health facility. She&#x2019;d made a name for herself authoring papers and conducting studies on the harmful effects of physical restraints and isolation on patients. The key to recovery, she proposed, was enabling the patient&#x2019;s sense of autonomy within a group dynamic. Treating them like humans. Imagine that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are flashcards okay?&#x201d; I figured I&#x2019;d start slow.<br> <br>Dr. Mehta nodded and sighed, pausing to stare at the blanks in the record on her computer. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re looking for any response at this point. Anything at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>I waited until after the dinner rounds were finished, when stomachs were full and the wind murmured invitations against the dark windows. This was the loneliest time of day, when you let yourself wish there was someone to talk to.<br> <br>A veteran orderly named Stan admitted me into the locked outer doors of ward four and walked me down the linoleum hallway lined with isolation rooms on either side. A few patients stared at us through the windows. One was banging his fist dully on the glass, but the rest sat on their beds or paced. I counted eight in total, eight patients who weighed more than they knew. All of them pressed on Dr. Mehta&#x2019;s conscience until she could get them safely reintegrated into the common wards.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re gonna have any luck with him,&#x201d; Stan said, keys jingling at his hip. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s completely ignored everyone who&#x2019;s gone in there except Carol.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carol Kelley was the seventy-year-old kitchen attendant who brought meals to all the isolation patients. She clipped herbs from her own garden to garnish the mush and served it like she was having Sunday dinner with friends around her kitchen table. Everybody loved Carol, even the sociopaths.<br> <br>&#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Examines things&#x2014;his clothes, the mattress. Feels the walls. Likes to drag the bed over to the window so he can see out. Stands there pressing the glass. Sometimes it looks like he&#x2019;s trying to break the whole damn thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Does he eat?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Any response to his name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh. Like a wall, that one. You could call him Tarzan and he wouldn&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lucas was his name. Lucas Blackthorn. He&#x2019;d been arrested for breaking and entering at an outfitter&#x2019;s store, attempted robbery of the store, and two counts of aggravated assault on the owners who&#x2019;d caught him in the act.<br> <br>Stan paused outside the room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right here at the window.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can take care of myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m standing outside the door, and not between you and Tarzan.&#x201d;<br> <br>Some of the orderlies resented my promotion, my leap from a blue-collar hourly wage into the hallowed ranks of the salaried, but not Stan. He gave me a grin, unlocked the door with a metal creak, and waved me inside. I stepped in and waited for it to shut behind me before looking up.<br> <br>The patient faced the back of the room with his hands on the cement block wall in a push-up position. From the way he stood with his shoulders tensed and legs braced it looked like he was trying to move the entire wall. I took a step closer and noticed his hospital shirt was torn at the bottom and he&#x2019;d used the missing strip to tie his hair back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Lucas.&#x201d;<br> <br>He remained still for a second, but then surprised me by turning his head. I saw his face in person for the first time.<br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t a boy.<br> <br>My brain stuttered on that one thought for what felt like a stupidly long time as our eyes met and held. Why did all the media keep calling him a boy? Lucas Blackthorn looked at least as old as me and stood a foot taller. His cheeks were hollow and shaded with the beginning of a beard. His skin was a deep reddish tan, not the pasty white of most of our long-term patients, and his eyes conveyed things that no first session speech therapy could have drawn out: intelligence and caution mixed with undisguised curiosity.<br> <br>Moving slowly and deliberately, I walked to the bare mattress between us. There was no table, so we&#x2019;d have to start the flashcards on the bed. He watched my progress, studying my hair. The short, pixie-cut combined with its dyed color grabbed a lot of patients&#x2019; attention. One of the men in ward two, a lifer named Big George with a traumatic brain injury, even liked to touch the ends of it that swished in front of my ears. I made sure he stuck to the left side so he didn&#x2019;t get distracted by the tiny silver hoop earrings along my right ear. Lucas noticed those, too. I watched him catalog every part of me, absorbing the appearance of this outsider to his room, like someone would analyze a newly discovered insect. His gaze paused on the blue fabric bag I carried, his expression unreadable now.<br> <br>I put a hand on my chest and waited until his attention snapped back to my face.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Maya.&#x201d; Three syllables. Slow rate, distinct pronunciation. I didn&#x2019;t smile. I&#x2019;d never trusted strangers who smiled at me&#x2014;they always wanted something.<br> <br>Patting the place where my pulse beat too fast, I nodded and said it again. &#x201c;Maya.&#x201d;<br> <br>He swiveled back toward the wall, dismissing the insect. I glanced behind me where Stan was shaking his head through the lead glass. Shrugging, I started to pull out the flashcards when suddenly Stan&#x2019;s face changed. His eyes widened and his mouth opened in a warning I couldn&#x2019;t hear.<br> <br>I hesitated and before I could turn around, a giant force threw me into the wall and something was being looped around my neck. The metal door shrieked as Stan wrenched it open and I was pulled back, my body turned into a human shield. The thing around my neck tightened and I panicked, unable to breathe. Lucas had my arms locked behind me in an impossibly strong grip. I fought against it, desperate to free myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keys,&#x201d; he said in a hoarse voice. I bowed my body against his, trying to find some slack in the cord around my throat, but met only a column of unyielding muscle. If anything, the cord grew tighter.<br> <br>My vision started to contract, black creeping in at the edges. I kicked viciously, striking his shins so hard they should have snapped in half, and used the rest of my oxygen in the process. The last thing I saw before everything went dark was Stan&#x2019;s hand, holding out his ring of keys.<br> <br>I came to on the floor in a gasping, head-pounding mess. Stan lay next to the door, unconscious, and Lucas Blackthorn was gone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Agghhh.&#x201d; I grabbed my head and waited for the air to work its way back through my body. When I could get up, I crawled over to check Stan&#x2019;s pulse and saw blood trickling down from his hairline. He was alive.<br> <br>A noise came from the hallway. Lots of noises, as my ears started registering them.<br> <br>I peeked out and saw patients at their isolation windows, banging and shouting. Farther down the hall, it became obvious what they were excited about: Lucas Blackthorn, trying to find the right key to get through the second set of doors.<br> <br>Without any conscious thought, I slipped Stan&#x2019;s baton from his belt and darted down the hallway with Lucas&#x2019;s back the only thing in focus, my progress muffled by the noise from the other patients. At Stan&#x2019;s station I tripped the emergency security button and lifted the baton. Lucas was only a few feet away now, punching key after key into the old locks, oblivious to the electronic security square mounted above.<br> <br>I waited, willing myself to breathe quietly while eyeing his upper arms, his thighs, the major muscle groups I could aim for without causing unnecessary injury. He couldn&#x2019;t have more than twenty pounds on me. Thirty, tops. My fingers flexed over the baton while I mentally traced the route from the front desk to this ward, counting the seconds until backup arrived. Then he flipped the keys over and found the badge, Stan&#x2019;s security badge, which he stared at for a split second before pressing it to the door, making it beep and flash green. I didn&#x2019;t hesitate this time. As soon as I heard the locks disengage, I swung the baton into his leg.<br> <br>He stumbled into the outer hallway, still on his feet, and started to run for the exit at the end of the corridor. I launched myself at him, jumping on his back and sending us both crashing into the wall and rolling to the floor.<br> <br>He scrambled to get up and I didn&#x2019;t care how famous he was, I didn&#x2019;t care if he was lost; there was no way this guy was escaping on my watch. I hooked my legs around his and locked the baton across his chest, trying to pin his arms. Shaking my hold, he flipped us both to our backs, crushing me underneath him, and grabbed for the baton.<br> <br>Voices and footfalls thundered toward us.<br> <br>&#x201c;A little help,&#x201d; I yelled and immediately regretted it. The words were like fire racing through my bruised throat, and I couldn&#x2019;t help the moan that followed them. At my sound of pain, he released his grip on the baton and fell inexplicably still. We both paused in that crazy position&#x2014;like a piggy-back ride tipped on its back&#x2014;before his weight disappeared, lifted off me by the cavalry of orderlies and security staff.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stan!&#x201d; I waved some of them toward the ward entrance, before being seized by a fit of coughing.<br> <br>Automatically I covered my throat with my hands, trying to stop the convulsions while the team clamored around, practically tripping over me to secure our wayward patient. Their boots braced and stomped inches from my head, sending vibrations through the linoleum and into my skull, which felt as fragile as an egg on concrete. No one offered to help me up. Their voices sounded far away, eclipsed by the pull and drag of air in my throat, the unsteady rise and fall of my chest. Only the tremor in the floor, the possibility of being trampled, made me turn my head to the side and that&#x2019;s when I saw him watching me.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d flipped him on his stomach and pulled his arms behind him. He was putting up no resistance and barely seemed aware of their efforts to subdue him. For a strange, endless moment, our stillness separated us from the rush of legs flooding the corridor, from the shouts and determination swarming above. We stared at each other, our faces both resting on the cold, flecked tiles less than three feet apart.<br> <br>Then a needle flashed in the fluorescent lights, the men picked him up, and Lucas Blackthorn was gone.</p><h2>Ilium</h2><p>Taking the events and characters of the Iliad as his jumping- off point, Dan Simmons has created an epic of time travel and savage warfare. Travellers from 40,000 years in the future return to Homer&#39;s Greece and rewrite history forever, their technology impacting on the population in a godlike fashion. This is broad scope space opera rich in classical and literary allusion, from one of the key figures in 1990s world SF. Ilium marks a return to the genre for one of its greats.</p><p>Genre-hopping Dan Simmons returns to science fiction with the vast and intricate masterpiece <i>Ilium</i>. Within, Simmons weaves three astounding story lines into one Earth-, Mars-, and Jupiter-shattering cliffhanger that will leave readers aching for the sequel. <p> On Earth, a post-technological group of humans, pampered by servant machines and easy travel via "faxing," begins to question its beginnings. Meanwhile, a team of sentient and Shakespeare-quoting robots from Jupiter's lunar system embark on a mission to Mars to investigate an increase in dangerous quantum fluctuations. On the Red Planet, they'll find a race of metahumans living out existence as the pantheon of classic Greek gods. These "gods" have recreated the Trojan War with reconstituted Greeks and Trojans and staffed it with scholars from throughout Earth's history who observe the events and report on the accuracy of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>. One of these scholars, Thomas Hockenberry, finds himself tangled in the midst of interplay between the gods and their playthings and sends the war reeling in a direction the blind poet could have never imagined. </p><p> Simmons creates an exciting and thrilling tale set in the thick of the Trojan War as seen through Hockenberry's 20th-century eyes. At the same time, Simmons's robots study Shakespeare and Proust and the origin-seeking Earthlings find themselves caught in a murderous retelling of <i>The Tempest</i>. Reading this highly literate novel does take more than a passing familiarity with at least <i>The Iliad</i> but readers who can dive into these heady waters and swim with the current will be amply rewarded. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Dan Simmons won the World Fantasy Award for his first novel, SONG OF KALI,. inspired by his travels in India. In the 1990s he rewrote the SF rulebook with his Hyperion Cantos quartet. He has also written thrillers. Alongside his writing he maintains a career as a college lecturer in English Literature in the USA.</p><h2>I AND THOU</h2><p>A modern translation clarifying the philosophical implications and use of words in the classic work of the Jewish religious scholar</p><p><i>I and Thou</i>, Martin Buber's classic philosophical work, is among the 20th century's foundational documents of religious ethics. "The close association of the relation to God with the relation to one's fellow-men ... is my most essential concern," Buber explains in the Afterword. Before discussing that relationship, in the book's final chapter, Buber explains at length the range and ramifications of the ways people treat one another, and the ways they bear themselves in the natural world. "One should beware altogether of understanding the conversation with God ... as something that occurs merely apart from or above the everyday," Buber explains. "God's address to man penetrates the events in all our lives and all the events in the world around us, everything biographical and everything historical, and turns it into instruction, into demands for you and me." Throughout <i>I and Thou</i>, Buber argues for an ethic that does not <i>use</i> other people (or books, or trees, or God), and does not consider them objects of one's own personal experience. Instead, Buber writes, we must learn to consider everything around us as "You" speaking to "me," and requiring a response. Buber's dense arguments can be rough going at times, but Walter Kaufmann's definitive 1970 translation contains hundreds of helpful footnotes providing Buber's own explanations of the book's most difficult passages. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Walter Kaufmann</b> is Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University.

How different is God from human beings? This is the theological question of transcendence, and theology has long struggled to find answers that affirm a human relationship with God. In this provocative new work, Mayra Rivera's answer is that God is not within human grasp but is always within human touch. With a strikingly relevant concept of God as transcendent within--transcendence different from the ideas of God as far away, as outside human life and experience, or as above the human plane of existence--Rivera concentrates on transcendence as a relationship and uses it to describe how humans can touch God. In doing so, she engages a number of theological movements, including liberation theology, Radical Orthodoxy, feminism, and postcolonialism.</p></p><p><b>Mayra Rivera</b> is Assistant Professor of Theology at Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, California.</p><h2>The Covenant (Abram&#39;s Daughters)</h2><p>In a story spanning three generations, four sisters in Lancaster County witness the secrets of their tiny home community as Leah suffers from her sister Sadie&#39;s shameful loss of innocence with an English boy and finds her own dreams of love with Jonas spinning out of control.</p><p>The powerful family saga of four Amish sisters whose way of life and faith in God are as enduring as Lancaster's signature horse and buggy.

As for the great fight over the ``canon,'' Knox refuses to be ruffled or alarmed, merely pointing out--perhaps optimistically--that if the classics are exchanged for other books, ``the new material will have to compete with the old, and if it is not up to the same high level it will sooner or later be rejected with disdain by the students themselves.'' Whether Knox sufficiently buttresses his arguments here to win the day in some imaginary and strenuously heated debate may not matter very much; his voice offers the high pleasures of enormous learnedness, great common sense, and simple clarity as he speaks (the essays all had their origins as talks) about the original meaning of the liberal arts, about the psychology and intellectual attitudes of the ancients--not avoiding their blemished views regarding women and slavery--and about the genuine contributions of the sophists, their best and deserved reputations besmirched for all of history by that zealous early promoter of political correctness, Plato. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In three erudite essays originally delivered as lectures, Knox stresses the relevance of the ancient Greeks (the "dead white males" of the title) to the modern world. Former director of Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies, Knox ( The Norton Book of Classical Literature ) defends the modern teaching of the humanities as "an education for democracy." While acknowledging the inferior status of women in ancient Greek society, he argues that women were a formidable presence in the household, and he finds in Greek epics, poetry and drama a wealth of assertive, active females. Knox portrays the Sophists, who taught rhetoric and poetry, as "the first professors of the humanities." It was the Sophists, not Socrates, who "brought theory down from the skies," he insists. He closes with an account of his year-long stay in Greece, where he found living ties between the country's ancient and contemporary language and culture. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Man Who Would Be F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2><p>Ghostwriting an expose+a7 of the dirty business behind megabuck book deals, and how they have launched handsome brat pack novelist Cam Noyes&#39;s career, Stewart Hoag is shocked when members of the publishing community are targeted for murder. Reissue.</p><p>David Handler has written eight novels featuring the mismatched crime-fighting duo of Mitch Berger and Des Mitry. His first, The Cold Blue Blood, was a Dilys Award finalist and BookSense Top Ten pick. He is also the author of eight novels about the witty and dapper celebrity ghostwriter Stewart Hoag and his faithful, neurotic basset hound, Lulu, including the Edgar- and American Mystery Award--winning The Man Who Would Be F. Scott Fitzgerald. David lives in a two-hundred-year-old carriage house in Old Lyme, Connecticut.In a wickedly amusing tale, Handler ( The Man Who Died Laughing ) pokes fun at wunderkind authors, unscrupulous agents, shady publishers and, of course, surly reviewers as he continues the adventures of his hero, ghostwriter Stewart "Hoagy" Hoag. Cameron Sheffield Noyes published his first novel, Bang , to great acclaim just before his 20th birthday, making him an instant celebrity--"a troubled young genius blessed with James Dean's looks and John McEnroe's personality." Unfortunately, he's also a celebrity with writer's block, says Noyes's agent, who hires Hoagy to help this hot property whip his life into a bestselling autobiography. Inteviewing him, Hoagy finds Noyes an appropriately melodramatic subject: a blue-blooded youth, orphaned young and thrust suddenly into the New York publishing scene. But clearly somebody doesn't like the story: Hoagy receives ominous warnings to quit the project. Just as his research reveals Noyes's touching memoirs as complete fabrication, both Noyes's publisher and ex-lover are murdered, and Noyes himself vanishes. New York's finest are on the case, but it's Hoagy with his sidekick, the delightful basset hound Lulu, who learns if Noyes's autobiography has a happy ending. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Attic Windows: Quilts with a View</h2><p>Attic Windows is a timeless technique for quilters of all ages and skill levels to use their imagination, creativity, and favorite motif fabrics.

It was the last season of unbridled hope for peace and prosperity; by Labor Day, the Nazis were in Poland. And nothing would come to symbolize this transformation from acute optimism to fear and dread more than the 1939 New York World&#x2019;s Fair. <br><br>A glorious vision of the future, the Fair introduced television, the fax machine, nylon, and fluorescent lights. The &#x201c;World of Tomorrow,&#x201d; as it was called, was a dream city built upon a notorious garbage dump&#x2014;The Great Gatsby&#x2019;s infamous ash heaps. Yet these lofty dreams would come crashing down to earth in just two years. From the fair&#x2019;s opening on a stormy spring day, everything that could go wrong did: not just freakish weather but power failures and bomb threats.<br><br>Amid the drama of the World&#x2019;s Fair, four men would struggle against the coming global violence. Albert Einstein, a lifelong pacifist, would come to question his beliefs as never before.

For often as not World's Fairs result in thumping deficits.-Time magazine, 1939<br><br>"Why Don't You Do It, Daddy?"<br><br>&nbsp;By all accounts, 1934 was a remarkable year: Flash Gordonmade his first appearance in the comic strips, and Frank Capra's It HappenedOne Night, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, would go on to win everymajor Academy Award. In May, one of the worst storms of the Dust Bowl sweptaway massive heaps of Great Plains topsoil; in August, Adolf Hitler becameGermany's new Fï¿½hrer. Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Bonnie and Clyde, andJohn Dillinger were all gunned down in spectacular, tabloid-titillatingfashion. On Broadway, Ethel Merman opened in Cole Porter's big new hit,Anything Goes; while farther uptown, in Harlem, seventeen-year-old EllaFitzgerald made her singing debut at the recently christened Apollo Theater.<br><br>&nbsp;But savvy New Yorkers, sophisticated or streetwise, hadsomething much more important on their minds. The repeal of Prohibition theprevious December had made it easier and cheaper, if somewhat less fun, tospend an evening socializing over a glass of beer or a highball. Almostovernight, some thirty thousand-plus speakeasies in the city closed their doorsfor good, to be replaced by everything from the neighborhood saloon to thetony, upscale supper club. In the late summer of that year, at a cocktail partyheld in an unremarkable tavern in Kew Gardens, Queens, that was neither saloonnor salon, a small group of would-be swells mingled and chatted amiably. Theywere by no means the cream of society (the Kew Gardens location could attest tothat), but some could claim proximity, or at least relation, to it.<br><br>&nbsp;One in particular was Edward Roosevelt, a stout, balding,bespectacled man whose round face and weak chin gave him the look of anelementary school principal or a henpecked husband. He was, however, a secondcousin of Eleanor Roosevelt and a sixth cousin of her husband, the president.The association wasn't doing him much good at the moment, though; like a lot ofother people in the country at that time, he was looking for work. He'd spentmost of his adult life in Europe as an executive at Ford and InternationalHarvester, but now that he was back in New York, he was living at a YMCA onWest Twentieth Street that catered mostly to the merchant marine. Despite hisportly physique, he paid for his room and board by working as a recreationalinstructor. Leading ancient, long-retired sailors in meaningless exercisesseemed like the depths of misery, and Roosevelt kept mostly to himself andwaited for something better to come along.<br><br>The party was in full swing when a friend tappedRoosevelt on the arm and introduced him to an energetic, sophisticated-lookingman who seemed particularly anxious to meet him. Edward squinted over hiswireless glasses and tried to decide exactly who would benefit whom over thisintroduction.<br><br>"Mr. Roosevelt, this is a Mr. Shadgen," hisfriend stated, adding, "Who has some distinct ideas about finewines."<br><br>&nbsp;Edward, having lived for quite some time in France, haddeveloped an interest in wines and decided to give this stranger his fullattention. At forty-three years old, Joseph Shadgen was broad-shouldered andstood six feet tall, a somewhat impressive figure compared with Roosevelt.Moreover, he was neatly dressed and impeccably well groomed. With the highsweep of his neatly combed, distinguished gray hair and the little swoosh of asilvering mustache that barely exceeded the width of his nose, he looked like amiddle-aged Charles Boyer. Before Shadgen opened his mouth to speak, Rooseveltprobably sensed he was European. The little bow he gave as they shook handsconfirmed it.<br><br>The two men, approximately the same age, shared aremarkable economic history, each having achieved an impressive degree ofsuccess early in life, only to find themselves thrust into financialuncertainty as a result of the Depression. The major difference between themwas that Roosevelt was an American who had sought his glory in Europe, whileShadgen was a European who had tried to seize the day in America.<br><br>&nbsp;As they spoke, casually at first, Roosevelt must havenoticed that Shadgen carried with him, in his manner and his carriage,something of an aristocrat, deserved or not. Although raised as a citizen ofBelgium, Shadgen had been born in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and when onehas had a grand duke as monarch, a little touch of nobility remains. In 1915,he had immigrated to America, and for the last ten years he'd worked as a civiland mechanical engineer for the firm of C. H. Smoot &amp; Company. He liked todescribe himself as an "idea man" and often boasted that he had oncemade as much as $150,000 a year.<br><br>This, unfortunately, was not one of those years. WhenCharles Howard Smoot died in 1933, Shadgen abruptly left the company and movedhis wife and young daughter from their oceanfront home in Brooklyn to a modesthouse in Jackson Heights, Queens-a sparsely populated area hard hit by hardtimes. He drove an old Packard that he kept in cold storage because it hadrecently refused to run.<br><br>When the conversation finally got around to wine,Shadgen's Belgian accent added a distinctly continental air of sophisticationto his pitch. For the last few months, he said, he had been working as atechnical consultant for the Rockefeller Liquor Study, which had beenanticipating all sorts of calamities now that the public was allowed to drinkthemselves silly again. And with the repeal of Prohibition, the trading andpurchasing of fine wines would surely regain its popularity with the Manhattanelite. But since most of them lived in apartments, however large, where onearth were they going to store it?<br><br>His idea was to form a company; rent a large, undergroundspace somewhere on Manhattan's Upper East Side (around twenty-five thousandsquare feet, he reckoned); and divide the area into mini-wine cellars. Then allhe had to do was rent the units, make sure the proper temperature wasmaintained, etc., etc., and he could sit back and rake in the money. All heneeded, Shadgen said, was a partner who could help him rope in a few key investorsto get it off the ground.<br><br>&nbsp;Edward nodded and listened intently. The fundamentals ofShadgen's wine storage idea seemed sound. With sufficient start-up money, therewas indeed no limit to the number of subterranean wine lockers they couldsublease.<br><br>From the start, it was an unlikely partnership. Shadgenwas a good talker who needed a door opener; Roosevelt was a (currently, atleast) poor relation who needed a project to which he could attach himself andthe meager connections his name brought with it. Miraculously, when the effectof their drinking wore off the next morning, Roosevelt still thought it was agood idea, and one that required immediate action. Shadgen and his new partnerspent the better part of the next several weeks almost inseparable-scouringsuitable storage locations, sketching out plans, and hunting down investors tofund the whole thing. They even rented desks in a cramped real estate officefrom which they would run their little company until the profits startedflowing in. It was all going well except for one small detail: Nobody elsethought the idea had merit, and no one would invest.<br><br>&nbsp;After weeks of frustration, watching his savings dwindleand his hopes of turning his friendship with a bona fide Roosevelt into his much-deservedfortune, Shadgen decided to give the partnership one more try. Privately, hehad another idea in mind-one much larger in scope and scale than the winestorage concept. In fact, it was so huge that he'd been reluctant to share itwith anyone, let alone his new partner.<br><br>It had come to him earlier that year, on a warm springevening while he waited for dinner and made small talk with his twelve-year-olddaughter, Jacqueline, who had just returned home from school. As she enteredthe room, still wearing her uniform from the nearby Blessed Sacrament Convent,Shadgen pulled her up next to him and asked, "Well, what did you learn inschool today?"<br><br>Jacqueline was probably too old for the question, but sheanswered it anyway. "I learned that the United States is a hundred and fifty-eightyears old this year," she told him.<br><br>Her father simply stared at her in silence. "Becausethe Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776," she explained.<br><br>Shadgen thought this over. He had a surprising grasp ofAmerican history for a foreigner, or perhaps because of it. This didn't makesense to him. The Declaration of Independence was merely that, he told her adeclaration, the signing of a document that spelled out only what the FoundingFathers intended to do. The nation, he believed, wasn't really "born"until it elected its first president, George Washington, in 1789.<br><br>Jacqueline gave him a suspicious look, and the two beganto argue. It was the word of the sisters at Blessed Sacrament versus herfather, who hadn't even been born here and who still spoke with an accent. TheFourth of July 1776 had been drummed into her head for as long as she couldremember as the nation's birthday.<br><br>&nbsp;"Oh no," he answered firmly. "The UnitedStates would be only a hundred and fifty years old in 1939."<br><br>When Mrs. Shadgen called out that dinner was ready, thetwo of them dropped the discussion and headed quietly for the dining room.Still, something had clicked in that stubborn, persistent brain of his.<br><br>The idea to host a World's Fair in order to boost NewYork City's economy at the end of the 1930s should have come from the minds ofits great community leaders. It didn't. "Don't get the idea that I wasdoing any of this for civic good will," Shadgen would later remark."I was working for two things-money and reputation."<br><br>To date, there had been exactly fourteen officiallyrecognized World's Fairs, and all but four of them had lost money.

The history of the legions is the collective story of those individuals, not just of Rome's famous generals. Men such as Titus Flavius Virilis, still serving as a centurion at the age of 70. And Titus Calidius, a cavalry decurion who missed military life so much after retiring he re-enlisted, at the reduced rank of optio. And Novantius, the British auxiliary from today's city of Leicester, who was granted his discharge thirteen years early for valiant service in the second century conquest of Dacia. Any analysis of the legions must begin with the men, their organization, their equipment, and their service conditions.</i> I. WHERE IT ALL BEGAN The origins of the legions of Pompey, Caesar, Augustus, Vespasian, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius go back to the Roman Republic of the fifth century BC. Originally, there were just four Roman legions - <i>Legios</i> I to IIII (the legion number 4 was written as IIII, not IV). Each of the two consuls, 'who were charged both singly and jointly to take care to preserve the Republic from danger', commanded two of these legions. [Vege., III] All legionaries were then property-owning citizens of Rome, conscripted in the spring of each year into the armies of the two consuls. Legio, the origin of the word 'legion', meant 'levy', or draft. Service ordinarily ended with the Festival of the October Horse on 19 October, which signalled the termination of the campaigning season. Men of 'military age' - 16 to 46 - were selected by ballot for each legion, with the 1st Legion considered to be the most prestigious. Rome's field army was bolstered by legions from allied Italian tribes. Legionaries of the early Republic were appointed to one of four divisions within their legion, based on age and property qualifications. The youngest men were assigned to the <i>velites</i>, the next oldest to the <i>hastati</i>, men in the prime of life to the <i>principes</i> and the oldest to the <i>triarii</i>, with the role and equipment of each group differing. By Julius Caesar's day, the conscripted infantry soldier of the Republic was required to serve in the legions for up to sixteen years, and could be recalled in emergencies for a further four years. Originally, republican legions had a strength of 4,200 men, which in times of special danger could be brought up to 5,000. [Poly., VI, 21] By 218 BC and the war between Rome and Carthage, the consuls' legions consisted of 5,200 infantry and 300 cavalry, which approached the form they would take in imperial times. From 104 BC, the Roman army of the Republic underwent a major overhaul by the consuls Publius Rutilius Rufus and Gaius Marius. Rutilius introduced arms drill and reformed the process of appointment for senior officers. Marius simplified the requirements for enrolment, so that it was not only property owners who were required to serve. Failure to report for military service would result in the conscript being declared a deserter, a crime subject to the death penalty. A legionary would be paid for the days he served - for many years, this amounted to ten asses a day. He was also entitled to the proceeds from any arms, equipment or clothing he stripped from the enemy dead, and was entitled to a share of the booty acquired by his legion. If a legion stormed a town, its legionaries received the proceeds from its contents - human and otherwise - which were sold to traders who trailed the legions. If a town surrendered, however, the Roman army's commander could elect to spare it. Consequently, legionaries had no interest in encouraging besieged cities to surrender. Marius focused on making the legions independent mobile units of heavy infantry. Supporting roles were left to allied forces. To increase mobility, Marius took most of the legionaries' personal equipment off the huge baggage trains which until then had trailed the legions, and put it on the backs of the soldiers, greatly reducing the size of the baggage train. With the items hanging from their baggage poles weighing up to 100 pounds (45 kilos), legionaries of the era were nicknamed 'Marius' mules'. Until that time, the maniple of 160 - 200 men had been the principal tactical unit of the legion, but under Marius' influence the 600-man cohort became the new tactical unit of the Roman army, so that the legion of the first century BC comprised ten cohorts, with a total of 6,000 men. Half a century later, Julius Caesar fashioned his legions around his own personality and dynamic style. Of the twenty-eight legions of Augustus' new standing army in 30 BC, some had been founded by Caesar, others moulded by him. The civil war, between the rebel Caesar and the forces of the republican Senate led by their commander Pompey the Great, created an insatiable demand for military manpower. At the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, Caesar led elements of nine legions; Pompey, twelve. For the 42 BC Battle of Philippi, two years after Caesar's murder, when Mark Antony, Marcus Lepidus and Octavian took on the so-called Liberators, Brutus and Cassius, more than forty legions were involved. II. SOLDIERING FOR AUGUSTUS The emperor Augustus, as Octavian became known from 27 BC, totally reformed the Roman army after he finally defeated Antony and Cleopatra in 30 BC. In the professional army of Augustus, the legionary was a full-time soldier, sometimes a volunteer but more often a conscript, who signed on, initially for sixteen and later twenty years. Towards the end of his forty-three-year reign, Augustus was to boast: 'The number of Roman citizens who bound themselves to me by military oath was about 500,000. Of these I settled in colonies or sent back into their own towns more than 300,000, and to all I assigned lands or gave money as a reward for military service.' [ <i>Res Gest.</i>, I, 3] That retirement payment was standardized by Augustus at 12,000 sesterces for legionaries, 20,000 for men of the Praetorian Guard. After the completion of his enlistment, an imperial legionary could be recalled in an emergency to the Evocati, a militia of retired legionaries. On Antony's death, Augustus controlled approximately sixty legions. Many of these were promptly disbanded. 'Others,' said Cassius Dio, 'were merged with various legions by Augustus', and as a result 'such legions have come to bear the name Gemina', meaning 'twin'. [Dio, LV, 23] By this process, Augustus created a standing army of 150,000 legionaries in twenty-eight legions, supported by 180,000 auxiliary infantry and cavalry, stationed throughout the empire. He also created a navy with two main battle fleets equipped with marines, and several smaller fleets. In addition, Augustus employed specialist troops at Rome - the elite Praetorian Guard, theCity Guard, the Vigiles or Night Watch, and the imperial bodyguard, the German Guard. In AD 6, Augustus set up a military treasury in Rome, initially using his own funds, which were given in his name and that of Tiberius, his ultimate successor. To administer the military treasury he appointed three former praetors, allocating two secretaries to each. The ongoing shortfall in the military treasury's funds was covered by a death duty of 5 per cent on all inheritances, except where the recipient was immediate family or demonstrably poor. III. ENLISTING AND RETIRING Some volunteers served in Rome's imperial legions - 'the needy and the homeless, who adopt by their own choice a soldier's life', according to Tacitus. [Tac., <i>A</i>, IV, 4] But most legionaries were conscripted. The selection criteria established by Augustus required men in their physical prime. A recruit's civilian skills would be put to use by the legion, so that blacksmiths became armourers, and tailors and cobblers made and repaired legionaries' uniforms and footwear. Unskilled recruits found themselves assigned to duties such as the surveyor's party or the artillery. When it was time for battle, however, all took their places in the ranks. A slave attempting to join the legions could expect to be executed if discovered, as happened in a case raised with the emperor Trajan by Pliny the Younger when he was governor of Bithynia-Pontus. Conversely, during the early part of Augustus' reign it was not uncommon for free men to pose as slaves to avoid being drafted into the legions or the Praetorian Guard when the <i>conquisitors</i>, or recruitment officers, periodically did the rounds of the recruitment grounds. This became such a problem that Augustus' stepson Tiberius was given the task of conducting an inquiry into slave barracks throughout Italy, whose owners were accepting bribes from free men to harbour them in the barracks when the conquisitors sought to fill their quotas. [Suet., III, 8] Once Tiberius became emperor the task of filling empty places in the legions became even more difficult. Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius, made a sycophantic yet revealing statement about legion recruitment in around AD 30: 'As for the recruiting of the army, a thing ordinarily looked upon with great and constant dread, with what calm on the part of the people does he [Tiberius] provide for it, without any of the usual panic attending conscription!' [Velle., II, CXXX] Tiberius, who followed Augustus' policy of recruiting no legionaries in Italy south of the River Po, broadly extended the draft throughout the provinces. Legionaries were not permitted to marry. Recruits who were married at the time of enrolment had their marriages annulled and had to wait until their enlistment expired to take a wife officially, although in practice there were many camp followers and many de facto relationships. The emperor Septimius Severus repealed the marriage regulation, so that from AD 197 serving legionaries could marry. For many decades, each imperial legion had its own dedicated recruitment ground. The 3rd Gallica Legion, for example, was for many years recruited in Syria, despite its name, while both 7th legions were recruited in eastern Spain. By the second half of the first century, for the sake of expediency, recruiting grounds began to shift; the 20th Legion, for instance, which had up to that time been recruited in northern Italy, received an increasing number of its men from the East. When a legion was initially raised, its enlistment took place en masse, which meant that a legion's men who survived battle wounds and sickness were later discharged together. As a result, as Scottish historian Dr Ross Cowan has observed, Rome 'had to replenish much of a legion's strength at a single stroke'. [Cow., <i>RL</i> 58 <i>-</i> 69] When a legion's discharge and re-enlistment fell due, all its recruits were enrolled at the same time. Although the official minimum age was 17, the average age of recruits tended to be around 20. Some old hands stayed on with the legions after their discharge was due, and were often promoted to optio or centurion. There are numerous gravestone examples of soldiers who served well past their original twenty-year enlistment. Based on such gravestone evidence, many historians believe that all legionaries' enlistments were universally extended from twenty to twenty-five years in the second half of the first century, although there is no firm evidence of this. Legions rarely received replacements to fill declining ranks as the enlistments of their men neared the end of their twenty years. Tacitus records replacements being brought into legions on only two occasions, in AD 54 and AD 61, in both cases in exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, legions frequently operated well under optimum strength. [Ibid.] By AD 218, mass discharges would be almost a thing of the past. The heavy losses suffered by the legions during the wars of Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus and Caracalla meant that the legions needed to be regularly brought up to strength again or they would have ceased to be effective fighting units. The short-lived emperor Macrinus (AD 217 - 218) deliberately staggered legion recruitment, for 'he hoped that these new recruits, entering the army a few at a time, would refrain from rebellion'. [Dio, LXXIX, 30] In 216 BC, two previous oaths of allegiance were combined into one, the <i>ius iurandum</i>, administered to legion recruits by their tribunes. From the reign of Augustus, initially on 1 January, later on 3 January, the men of every legion annually renewed the oath of allegiance at mass assemblies: 'The soldiers swear that they will obey the emperor willingly and implicitly in all his commands, that they will never desert, and will always be ready to sacrifice their lives for the Roman Empire.' [Vege., II] On joining his legion, the legionary was exempt from taxes and was no longer subject to civil law. Once in the military, his life was governed by military law, which in many ways was more severe than the civil code. IV. SPECIAL DUTIES Legions' headquarters staff included an adjutant, clerks and orderlies who were members of the legion. The latter, called <i>benificiari,</i> were excused normal legion duties and were frequently older men who had served their full enlistment but who had stayed on in the army. V. DISCIPLINE AND PUNISHMENT <i>'I want obedience and self-restraint from my soldiers just as much as courage in the face of the enemy.'</i> JULIUS CAESAR, <i>The Gallic War</i>, VII, 52 &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Tight discipline, unquestioning obedience and rigid training made the Roman legionary a formidable soldier. Roman military training aimed not only to teach men how to use their weapons, it quite deliberately set out to make legionaries physically and mentally tough fighting machines who would obey commands without hesitation. As one of the indications of his rank, every centurion carried a vine stick, the forerunner of the swagger stick of some modern armies. Centurions were at liberty to use their sticks to thrash any legionary mercilessly for minor infringements. A centurion named Lucilius, who was killed in the AD 14 Pannonian mutiny, had a habit of brutally breaking a vine stick across the back of a legionary, then calling 'Bring another!', a phrase that became his nickname. [Tac., <i>A</i>, I, 23] For more serious infringements, legionaries found guilty by a court martial conducted by the legion's tribunes could be sentenced to death. Polybius described the crimes for which the death penalty was prescribed in 150 BC - stealing goods incamp, giving false evidence, homosexual offences committed by those in full manhood, and for lesser crimes where the offender had previously been punished for the same offence three times. The death penalty was later additionally prescribed for falling asleep while on sentry duty. Execution also awaited men who made a false report to their commanding officer about their courage in the field in order to gain a distinction, men who deserted their post in a covering force, and those who through fear threw away weapons on the battlefield. [Poly., VI, 37] If whole units were involved in desertion or cowardice, they could be sentenced to decimation: literally, reduction by one tenth. Guilty legionaries had to draw lots. One in ten would die, with the other nine having to perform the execution. Decimation sentences were carried out with clubs or swords or by flogging, depending on the whim of the commanding officer. Survivors of a decimated unit could be put on barley rations and made to sleep outside the legion camp's walls, where there was no protection against attack.

Deeply moved by these small deaths since her childhood in South Australia, photographer-artist Kate Breakey has been photographing found animal remains since the mid-1990s, creating stunning, oversized, hand-colored images that&#x2014;paradoxically&#x2014;glow with life.</p> <p>This volume is the first book-length work devoted to the photographs of Kate Breakey. It gathers color images from her ongoing "Small Deaths" series. These birds, flowers, lizards, and insects vividly express Breakey's desire to preserve each lost creature&#x2014;to "freeze it in time, suspend it in space, immortalize it so that its beauty and its death are memorialized." In a brief afterword, Breakey traces the origins of her art to a childhood spent among domestic and rescued animals on the Australian coast. In the introduction, noted art critic A. D. Coleman links Breakey's work to the larger traditions of still-life painting and the postmortem photography of the nineteenth century.</p></p><p>Since 1980, Kate Breakey&#x2019;s photography has appeared in over thirty one-woman exhibitions and in over thirty group exhibitions in the United States, Australia, Japan, and France. It is also held in numerous public collections, including the San Diego Museum of Photographic Arts, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Center for Creative Photography, Tucson, Arizona, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, the Australian National Gallery, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the Art Gallery of South Australia, as well as various private collections. Currently, Kate Breakey lives and works in Tucson, Arizona.This elegantly designed book features 81 photographs by Australian-born artist Breakey, a self-proclaimed naturalist who makes "post-mortem" photographs of birds, plants, and other small creatures. These oddly reverent "portraits" of dead subjects are enhanced with such creative photographic techniques as shallow depth of field and painstaking hand coloring methods that transform decaying animals and plants into colorful and romantic memorials. Breakey, who has exhibited widely in the United States and abroad, credits the influence of natural history dioramas, but the works here are firmly rooted in fine art photography, not science or history. Noted photography critic A.D. Coleman's insightful foreword draws comparisons between Breakey's work and the history of art and photography, but Small Deaths is essentially a collection of beautiful, highly personal photographs, not a scholarly or theoretical work.

But then perhaps the Russians hadn't expelled a great poet so much as exposed us to one of their virulent personality cults. Yet Brodsky's essays are interesting. Composed in a rather heroically determined English, clumsily phrased and idiomatically challenged, they are still inventive and alive. There are suggestive analyses of favorite poems by Hardy, Rilke, and Frost in this book, and a moving meditation on the figure of Marcus Aurelius. Though too often Brodsky goes on at self-indulgent length, he usually recaptures our attention with a characteristic aside: 'The fact that we are livingdoes not mean we are not sick.'" --<i>Boston Review</i> <br><br>"Brodsky has the reputation of being one of the best essayists in the English language, and it doesn't take many pages of reading this new collection to realize why.

His keen and passionate poet's mind often homes in on unexpected details, as in <i>Alter Ego</i>, a short dissertation on the poet and the subject of love.

He championed "Truth, Justice, and the American Way" in the 1950s and was such a popular hero that as many as 20,000 children would show up at his personal appearances. In his private life, though, he was a sad man. Frustrated by chronic poverty, in part because his film prospects didn't pan out, he became the "kept man" of an older lover, the wife of a powerful MGM executive. When he died just two years after filming the last episode of <i>The Adventures of Superman</i>, the Los Angeles police called it suicide, but many questions were left unanswered. As mystery author James Crumley writes, "The characters leap off the page like the television Superman in his padded suit. When the mystery is finally revealed, George Reeves, in his tragic death, approaches heroic stature in a way he never did in life."When George Reeves, who had achieved international fame by playing Superman for five years on TV, was found dead by gunshot in 1959, the death was officially recorded as a suicide. According to Kashner and Schoenberger (A Talent for Genius), however, unanswered details about Reeves's demise shroud what in truth was foul play. In this page-turning hybrid of bio and murder mystery, the authors entertainingly pick at the loose ends and point their pens at a killer. Reeves, they show, was hardly as wholesome as his TV image implied. His life was filled with hard-drinking men, manipulative women, mafiosos and a career that plummeted like a comet after The Adventures of Superman went off the air. The authors set down this B movie-style tale with hard-boiled relish. They introduce archetypal sleazebag characters with an entertaining terseness?"Eddie was a tough guy with a heart of tungsten"; "Leonore Lemmon wore the reddest lipstick in New York"?that occasionally veers into cheap Hammett imitations. The well-articulated backdrop of low-budget TV production only enhances the cheesy milieu, however. By laying out Reeves's life before solving the mystery of his death, the authors present the equivalent of a crisp black-and-white TV docudrama, and manage to evoke all the irresistibly creepy nostalgia of a bygone era.

The first non-European to win the Yellow Jersey, he broke the Old World stranglehold and changed the face of the competition.<br>&nbsp;<br>But LeMond's victory was hard won. It was seemingly snatched from the jaws of the man ominously dubbed 'The Badger'. Frenchman Bernard 'Le Blaireau' Hinault was five times winner of the Tour and as tough as boots. After winning the 1985 Tour, in which LeMond came a close second, Hinault vowed to return for one final Tour, and with a single purpose: to help LeMond win.<br>&nbsp;<br>But could Hinault be trusted? As the race circled France, he repeatedly attacked LeMond. Hinault claimed to the press that his apparent treachery was merely intended to make LeMond stronger. But LeMond, who didn't believe him, became increasingly fearful, anxious and paranoid.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Tour is renowned for its psychological complexity - but what played out in 1986 was unheard of. Why was Hinault putting his own teammate in jeopardy? Would LeMond crack under the pressure? Something sinister was going on but no one - not even LeMond -- knew quite what.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><b>Slaying the Badger</b><i> </i>relives the adrenaline, the agony, the camaraderie, the betrayals, and the pure exhilaration of the 1986 Tour.

By the author of Brother Juniper&#39;s Bread Book.</p><p><b>Peter Reinhart</b> is a lay brother in the Christ the Savior Brotherhood, an eastern orthodox service order. He is the author of the James Beard Award-winning cookbook <i>Crust &amp; Crumb</i> and the editor of the chapter on bread in the revised edition of <i>Joy of Cooking</i>. After teaching breads for four years at the California Culinary Academy, he is now a faculty member at Johnson &amp; Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island.Reinhart (Brother Juniper's Bread Book, not reviewed) is back with philosophical musings and recipes from the California restaurant he and his wife began as members of a Christian order. (He has since sold his interest in Brother Juniper's Caf&#x201a;, named after a hapless but generous monk.) His writing is cheerily helpful, and he exhibits a quirky sense of humor in relating episodes like the time he visited Israel with his Jewish father and was expelled from the Mosque of Omar for engaging in prayer. (``Only Muslims may pray here...It is the rules of the management,'' a guard insisted.) Recipes are straight out of the Chez Panisse school--the black-bean chili was inspired by a very similar dish served at San Francisco's top-flight vegetarian restaurant Greens--but Reinhart gives preparations an original spin. A simple mesclun salad is enhanced by fresh herbs and a lemony caper dressing, and hummus gets a lift from freshly toasted sesame seeds pureed with olive oil in place of the usual pre-fab tahini. On the other hand, a heavy dose of buttermilk intended to moisten oversize lemon muffins instead gives them an unbearably acidic taste. Reinhart apparently has the heart of an entrepreneur: He has marketed a bottled barbecue sauce called Holy Smoke and admits to fantasies about ``putting Coke and Pepsi out of business'' with natural brews like root beer made with sarsaparilla and wild cherry bark.

Here is a handy geometrical explanation for fatuous love (passion + commitment), companionable twosomes (commitment + intimacy), stagnant duos that go on for years with commitment but no passion, and the rare, consummate romance which combines all elements of the triangle. Sternberg, author of The Triarchic Mind , often daunts the general reader with love scales, lists, diagrams and tedious summaries of scientific research on love. His own investigations yielded surprising conclusions: passion and sex increase rather than decrease in importance over the first few years of a marriage; whether a person comes from a loving family is a poor predictor of how much she or he will love you. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Yale psychologist Sternberg provides an intelligible overview of theory and research on the psychology of heterosexual love. Growing out of his own and others' empirical investigations, Sternberg's "triangular" concept of love comprises three key componentsintimacy, passion, and commitment. Sternberg gives guidelines for analyzing these components, whose strength vary over time, and for enhancing relationships. Without jargon or condescension he uses pithy anecdotes to explain the implications of key discoveries from the new field of love research to refute common myths about love. An illuminating book, highly recommended for general collections.

"Lighthearted and entertaining." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>Bill Mares graduated cum laude in history from Harvard and holds an M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. He served from 1985-1991 in the Vermont House of Representatives, is a former journalist and has written eight previous books. He teaches history at Champlain Valley Union High School in Vermont."All men," Herbert Hoover noted, "are equal before fish." Even presidents. Mares, former member of the Vermont House of Representatives and author of eight previous books, has written an informative and often witty book on the fishing exploits of America's presidents. We learn that George Washington was, for a time, a commercial fisherman, that FDR had a special chair built into his boats to allow him to fish, and that Ike tried in vain to teach his vice-presidential running mate Richard Nixon to fly fish. "It was a disaster," Nixon admitted. "After hooking a limb the first three times, I caught my shirt on the fourth try. The lessons ended abruptly." Jimmy Carter loved fishing but admitted to being "piscatorially retarded." This lighthearted and entertaining book offers insights into the personalities and leisure habits of the presidents. Mares, it should be noted, rates Grover Cleveland as his favorite presidential fisherman. Recommended for larger public libraries.?Michael A.

It offers inspiration for home woodworking enthusiasts as well as architects, conservationists, and anyone interested in energy-efficient building and sustainability. The variety and ingenuity of the world&#x2019;s vernacular building traditions are richly illustrated, and the materials and techniques are explored. With examples from every continent, the book documents the diverse methods people have used to create shelter from locally available natural materials, and shows the impressively handmade finished products through diagrams, cross-sections, and photographs. Unlike modern buildings that rely on industrially produced materials and specialized tools and techniques, the everyday architecture featured here represents a rapidly disappearing genre of handcrafted and beautifully composed structures that are irretrievably "of their place." These structures are the work of unsung and often anonymous builders that combine artistic beauty, practical form, and necessity.</p><p><b>John May</b> is a writer and journalist based in London, England.

Despite accidents, misadventures, contrasts and the political instability of the Great Red Island, they returned with a lasting respect for the kindness of its proud people.</p><p>Dervla Murphy has written more than twenty books recounting her adventures all over the world on foot, mule, bicycle, and just about every other conveyance imaginable. Her books Full Tilt, Eight Feet in the Andes, The Waiting Land, Muddling Through in Madagascar, On a Shoestring to Coorg, Cameroon with Egbert, Transylvannia and Beyond, The Ukimwi Road, and South from the Limpopo are available from The Overlook Press.Readers who have followed Murphy's adventures ( Full Tilt: Ireland to India with a Bicycle ; In Ethiopia with a Mule ) know she is a dauntless traveler, unfazed by the unexpected and physically able to face rigorous conditions. But the Republic of Malagasy (Madagascar) was a challenge. Murphy and her 14-year-old daughter Rachel made their way across and around the southern two-thirds of this fabled island, finding spectacular scenery and severe erosion; there was no reliable modern communication system or transport network, and sanitary conditions were best left unmentioned. Murphy interweaves the story of their adventures with an account of the island's history and its peoples. Nominally Christian, they retain an unusual form of ancestor worship and some animalism with complex taboos ( fady ). The author found them gentle and courteous, untouched by tourism and without a work ethicnearly everything on the island appeared to be crumbling, from infrastructure to education, under Malagasy management. This is a lively tale of adventure in an exotic environment.

You&#39;ll find out not only how the boat is built, but also how the design came to be from someone with a (long!) lifetime of fooling around with boats. As told from Toad&#39;s Landing, on an island off British Columbia, it becomes quite apparent that whimsy and fun are not limited to young boys and girls. The first thing you may notice about Tom Cat is the handsome cuddy. The next thing to realize is she is constructed with a combination of the traditional-plank-on-frame (carvel) and modern-epoxy for the seams. The result is a rugged boat which doesn&#39;t require the swelling of planks, or the recaulking of seams in the years to come. If you are just too pure a traditionalist for epoxy, of course you can plank and caulk.</p><p></p><h2>Form Line of Battle</h2><p><p>The scene is Gibraltar, 1793. The gathering might of revolutionary France prepares to engulf Europe in another bloody war. As in the past, Britain will stand or fall by the fighting power of her fleet. For Richard Bolitho, the renewal of hostilities means a fresh command and the chance of action.</p></p><p><p>Alexander Kent, pen name of Douglas Edward Reeman, joined the British Navy at 16, serving on destroyers and small craft during World War II, and eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant. He has taught navigation to yachtsmen and has served as a script adviser for television and films. His books have been translated into nearly two dozen languages.</p>Chapter 1 The Old Hyperion <p>The frigate Harvester, nine days outward bound from Spithead, turned easily into the gentle offshore breeze and dropped anchor, the echoes of her gun salute reverberating and grumbling around the towering wall of Gibraltar's unchanging Rock. Her young captain let his eye rest a moment longer on the busy activity below the quarterdeck as his men threw themselves into the work of swaying out boats, urged on by sharp commands and more than one cuff from an impatient petty officer. Entering harbour was always a tense moment, and the captain knew that he was not the only one aboard who was aware of the big ships of the line anchored nearby, the largest of which wore a vice-admiral's flag at the fore, and no doubt there were several telescopes already trained on his small command ready to reprimand or criticise. </p><p>With a final glance he strode aft and crossed to the starboard side where a tall, solitary figure leaned against the hammock nettings. </p><p>"Shall I signal for a boat, sir? Or would one of mine be sufficient?" </p><p>Captain Richard Bolitho pulled himself from his thoughts and turned to face the other man. </p><p>"Thank you. Captain Leach, I will take yours. It will save time." He imagined he saw a touch of relief in the man's eyes, and realised that it could not have been easy for so young and junior a captain, who had not yet attained the coveted post rank, to carry him from England as a passenger. </p><p>He relaxed slightly and added, "You have a fine ship. We made a quick passage." He shivered in spite of the early morning sunlight and saw Leach watching him with new interest. But what could he understand of Bolitho's feelings? While the frigate had beaten down the English Channel and round Brest, where once more the British squadrons rode out all weathers to watch over a blockaded French fleet, Bolitho's thoughts had reached far beyond the plunging bowsprit to this moment only. Down across the Bay, with its blustering winds and savage currents, and still further south until the coast of Portugal loomed like a blue mist far abeam. He had had plenty of time to think of what lay ahead, of his new command, and all that she might come to mean to him. In his solitary walks on the frigate's spray-dashed quarterdeck he had been conscious of his role as a mere passenger, and more than once had had to check himself from interfering in the running of the ship. </p><p>Now, beneath the Rock's great shadow, he must push such thoughts out of his mind. He was no longer a frigate captain with all the independence and dash that post entailed. Within minutes he would take command of a ship of the line, one of those which swung so calmly and so confidently above their reflections just two cables distant. He made himself look squarely at the one which lay astern of the flagship. A two-decker, one of the seventy-four-gun ships which made up the backbone of England's far-stretched squadrons. The frigate beneath his feet moved restlessly even within the calm waters of the anchorage, her tapered topmasts spiralling against the washed-out blue sky, her rigging humming as if from impatience at the very necessity of being near her heavier consorts. By comparison the two-decker looked squat and unmoving, her towering masts and yards, her double line of ports, adding to her appearance of ponderous power, around which the busy harbour craft scurried like so many water-beetles. </p><p>The other man watched the gig being rowed round to the entry port and saw Bolitho's coxswain standing beside a pile of personal luggage like a thickest dog guarding his master's most prized possessions. </p><p>He said, "You've a good man there, sir." </p><p>Bolitho followed his glance and smiled. "Allday has been with me since . . ." His mind went back over the years without effort, as if every thought and each memory was always lying in wait like a half-forgotten picture. He said abruptly, "My first coxswain was killed at the Saintes in '82. Allday has been with me ever since." Just a few words of explanation, yet how much more they meant to Bolitho, just as Allday's familiar shape was a constant reminder. Now the Saintes and the frigate Phalarope were eleven years in the past, and England was at war again. Leach watched Bolitho's grave face and wondered. During the uneventful voyage from Spithead he had wanted to confide with him, but something had stopped him. He had brought plenty of other passengers to Gibraltar and usually they made a pleasant diversion in the daily routine. Officers for the garrison, couriers and replacements for men killed by accident or design in a war which was already spreading in every direction. But something in Bolitho's impassive, almost withdrawn manner had deterred him from close contact. He looked at him now with a mixture of interest and envy. Bolitho was a senior captain and about to take a step which with any luck at all would place him on the list for flag rank within a few years, maybe only months. </p><p>From what Bolitho had said he guessed him to be in his middle or late thirties. He was tall and surprisingly slim, and when he smiled his face became equally youthful. It was said that Bolitho had been away for several years between the wars in the Great South Sea and had come back half dead with fever. It was probably true, he decided. There were deep lines at the corners of his mouth, and beneath the even tan there was a certain fineness to the skin and cheekbones which betrayed such an illness. But the hair which was pulled back to the nape of his neck was black, without even a touch of grey, and the one lock which curled down above his right eye added to his appearance of controlled recklessness. A lieutenant touched his hat, "Boat's ready, sir." </p><p>Bolitho held out his hand. "Well, goodbye for the present, Leach. No doubt we will meet again directly." </p><p>The frigate's captain smiled for the first time. "I hope so, sir." He snapped his fingers with sudden irritation. "I almost forgot! There is a midshipman aboard who is also appointed to your ship. Will he go across with you?" </p><p>He spoke carelessly, as if he were discussing a piece of unwanted baggage, and Bolitho grinned in spite of his inner anxiety. "We were all midshipmen once, Leach." He nodded. "He can come with me." </p><p>Bolitho climbed down the ladder to the entry port where the bosun's mates and marines were assembled to see him over the side. His boxes had already vanished, and Allday was waiting by the bulwark, his eyes watching Bolitho as he knuckled his forehead and reported, "All stowed, Captain." </p><p>Bolitho nodded. There was something very reassuring about Allday. He was no longer the lithe topman he had once been. He had filled out now, so that in his blue jacket and wide duck trousers he looked muscular and unbreakable, like a rock. But his eyes were still the same. Half thoughtful, half amused. Yes, it was good to have him here today. Then Bolitho saw the midshipman. He got a quick impression of a pale, delicate face and a thin, gangling body which did not seem able to hold still. It was odd that he had not seen him before within the close world of the frigate, he thought. </p><p>As if reading his mind Leach said shortly, "He's been seasick for most of the voyage." </p><p>Bolitho asked kindly, "What is your name, boy?" </p><p>The midshipman began, "S-S-Seton, sir." Then he lapsed into blushing silence. </p><p>Leach said unfeelingly, "He stutters, too. I suppose we must take all kinds in times like these." </p><p>Bolitho hid a smile. "Quite so." He waited a moment and then added, "Well, Mr. Seton, you go down into the boat first, if you please." He saw the boy's mind wrestling with this early complication in his new career and then said, "Carry on, Allday." </p><p>He hardly heard the twitter of pipes or the harsh bark of commands, and only when the gig had moved clear of the frigate's hull and the oars sent her skimming across the unbroken water did he permit himself another glance at his new ship. </p><p>Allday followed his stare, and said quietly, "Well there she is, Captain. The old Hyperion." </p><p>As the little gig pulled steadily over the blue water Bolitho concentrated his full attention on the anchored Hyperion. Allday had perhaps made his comment without thought, yet his words seemed to jar another chord in Bolitho's mind as if to rule out this further meeting as mere coincidence. </p><p>Hyperion was an old ship, for it was twenty-one years since her keel had first tasted salt water, and Bolitho's rational mind told him that it was inevitable he should see her from time to time as his service carried him from one part of the world to the next. Yet whenever his mind and body had been tried to the limit it now seemed as if this old ship of the line had somehow been close by. At the bloody battles of the Chesapeake, and again at the Saintes, when his own beloved frigate had almost been pounded into submission, he had seen her blunt bows thrusting through the thickest of the smoke, her sides flashing with gunfire and sails pockmarked with holes as she fought to hold her place in the line. He narrowed his grey eyes as the sunlight lanced up from the water and threw a pattern of dancing reflections across the ship's tall side. He knew that she had been in steady commission now for over three years and had returned home from the West Indies with high hopes for a quick pay-off and well-earned rest both for herself and her company. But while Hyperion had sailed serenely on her peacetime affairs in the Caribbean sunlight and Bolitho had fought wretchedly against a consuming fever in his house at Falmouth, the clouds of war had gathered once more across Europe. The bloody revolution which had seized France from coast to coast had at first been viewed with nervous excitement from across the English Channel, a human reaction of people who watch an old enemy weakened from within without cost to themselves, but as the fury spread and the stories filtered back to England of a new, even more powerful nation emerging from the din of execution squads and mob carnage, those who had known danger and fear in the past accepted the inevitability of yet another war. </p><p>Followed by an anxious and protesting Allday, Bolitho had left his bed and had made his way to London. He had always detested the false gaiety of the town, with its sprawling, dirty streets and the contrasting splendour of its great houses, but he had made up his mind that if necessary he would bend his knee and plead for a new ship. </p><p>After weeks of fretting and fruitless interviews he had been given the task of recruiting unwilling inhabitants of the Medway towns to fill the ships which were at last being called into commission. </p><p>To the senior powers of the Admiralty whose immediate duty it was to expand and equip a depleted fleet Bolitho was a clever choice for the work of recruitment. His exploits as a young frigate captain were still well remembered, and when war came his was the kind of leadership which might win men from the land for the uncertainties and hardships of a life at sea. Unfortunately Bolitho did not view his appointment with the same enthusiasm. It was somehow characteristic of his make-up that he saw it as a lack of confidence and trust by his superiors whom he suspected of thinking the worst about his recent illness. A sick captain could be a danger. Not just to himself and his ship, but to the vital chain of command, which once weakened could bring disaster and defeat. </p><p>The following January England had reeled from the news that the King of France had been beheaded by his own people, and before their minds could adjust to the shock the new French National Convention declared war. It was as if the fury of the whole French nation had shaken the country from the course of reason. Even Spain and Holland, old allies from the past, had received the same declaration, and now, like England, stood awaiting the first real onslaught. </p><p>And so the old Hyperion had sailed again with hardly a pause in harbour. To Brest and the inevitable lot of the Channel Squadron to blockade and watch over the French ships sheltering beneath the guns of the shore batteries. </p><p>Bolitho had continued with his task, his despair at not being given an immediate command only helping to play fresh havoc with his health. Then as winter gave way to spring he had received his orders to proceed to Spithead and take passage for Gibraltar. As he sat in the stern of the gig he could feel the heavy envelope in his breast pocket, the authority to control and command this ship which now towered above him and reduced all else to insignificance. </p><p>Already he could hear the twitter of pipes, the stampede of bare feet and the clatter of muskets as she prepared to receive him. He wondered briefly how long they had awaited his appearance, whether or not his arrival would be greeted with pleasure or misgivings. </p><p>It was one thing to take command from another captain who was leaving for promotion or retirement, quite another to step into a dead man's shoes. The gig rounded the high bows and Bolitho stared up at the bright overhanging figurehead. Like the rest of the paintwork the figurehead's gilt looked fresh and clean which was one small sign of a well-run ship. Hyperion the Sun God carried an out-thrust trident and was crowned with the rising sun itself. Only a pair of staring blue eyes broke the sheen of gold, and Bolitho found time to wonder how many of the King's enemies had seen that gilt face through the smoke and had died minutes later. He looked round as he heard something like a gasp and saw the thin midshipman staring up at the towering masts and furled sails. His face seemed full of dread, and the hand which gripped the boat's gunwale was stiff like a claw. Bolitho asked quietly, "How old are you, Mr. Seton?" The boy tore his eyes from the ship and muttered, "S-Sixteen, sir." Bolitho nodded gravely. "Well, I was about your age when I joined a ship very like this one. That was the year Hyperion was built." He gave a wry smile. "And as you see, Mr. Seton, we are both still here!" </p><p>He saw the emotions chasing each other across the midshipman's pale face and was glad he had omitted to add that the occasion he had described had been his second ship. At that time, and from the age of twelve, he had been constantly at sea. He wondered why Seton's father had left it so late before sending him into the Navy. </p><p>He straightened his back as the boat shot forward towards the entry port and a voice rang out, "Boat ahoy?" </p><p>Allday cupped his hands and yelled, "Hyperion!" </p><p>If doubt there had been, there was none now. Every man aboard would know that the straight-backed figure in the gold-laced hat was his new master, the man who, next to God, held complete sway over every life in his ship. One who could flog or hang, just as he could equally reward and recognise the faults or efforts of everybody under his hand. </p><p>As the oars were tossed and the bowman hooked on to the main chains it took all of Bolitho's self-control to hold himself motionless in the sternsheets. Strangely, it was the seasick midshipman who broke the spell. He made to scramble towards the side, but Allday growled, "Not yet, my young gentleman!" He pulled him back to his seat and added, "Seniors are last in the boat but first out, got it?" </p>&lt;...</p><h2>A Modern Herbal : The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folklore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs and Trees with ...

The pliable metals, membrane structures, lightweight glasses and plastics used in building construction are creeping onto the catwalk. As they do so, their impact on recent textile developments has produced fabrics that enable clothing to act as individual climate-controlled environments that can exchange information with embedded sensors, resulting in wearable &#x2018;dwellings&#x2019; that act as both shelter and clothing. At the same time, architects are borrowing the techniques of pleating, stapling, cutting and draping from traditional tailoring to design buildings that are flexible, interactive, inflatable and even portable. <br><br>Although the relationship between architecture and fashion was recognized more than a century ago, the connection between them has rarely been explored by historians, designers or practicing architects. The Fashion of Architecture is the first attempt to investigate the contemporary relationship between architecture and fashion in considerable depth, by examining the ideas, imagery, techniques and materials used by visionaries such as Martin Margiela, Issey Miyake, Alexander McQueen, Tadao Ando and Daniel Libeskind. As mavericks ranging from Hussein Chalayan and Rei Kawakubo to Rem Koolhaas and Zaha Hadid describe architecture&#x2019;s role in the formation of fashion identities, new readings of both areas emerge. Probing and far-reaching in its content, The Fashion of Architecture is the most comprehensive study of this exciting area to date. <br></p><p>Bradley Quinn is an author and journalist.<br>"We've always admitted the links between car design and architecture, but buildings and fashion?

T<i>he Fashion of Architecture</i> reveals congruencies that many (in both industries) might prefer to ignore... to their peril."--Henrietta Thompson, Editor, <i>Blueprint</i><br><br>"Bradley Quinn traces the structures and spatial boundaries that are the common guidelines of fashion designers and architects and succeeds in pinpointing the similarities and differences these creative fields have gone through in the last century. <i>The Fashion of Architecture</i> is an accurate and detailed account of their mutual influences."--Boris Moshkovits, Berliner Magazine<br><br>'Bradley Quinn has written an original and insightful study of what is often a murky subject, superficially handled--the productive dialogue of fashion, art, and architecture. Larger thematic discussions alternate with fascinating case studies of individual designers, artists, architects--even department stores, to provide a host of new observations and genuine connections that were, until now, quiteobscure.

If I share a secret or some special wisdom, knowledge, or practical technique, or if I offer any kind of service, you must understand why I am doing it. Does this service benefit you? If there is no benefit, why do I need to share it? Why do you need to do it? Therefore, <i>why</i> is very important in all of my writings and teachings.<br> <br><i>How?</i> &#x201c;How&#x201d; refers to the method or technique to accomplish a goal. If I teach or offer any service, how do you do it? How can you carry out the methods and strategies? In my Soul Power Series the <i>how</i> includes practical techniques for healing, rejuvenation, and transformation of relationships and finances, as well as of every aspect of life. Techniques are very important. The Divine Forgiveness Practice is an example.<br> <br>To teach or achieve anything in your life there are two parts: theory and practice. Theory and practice are yin and yang. Yin and yang are opposites but united. They complement one another. To accomplish anything you must include both yin and yang. You cannot accomplish your task or goal by using only yin or only yang.<br> <br>I am extremely blessed that the Divine has chosen me as a servant, vehicle, and channel for humanity and the Divine. The Divine has given me the authority to offer permanent divine treasures to humanity. Divine treasures carry divine power to heal and transform all life, but recipients must practice in order to receive the benefits. This belongs to the <i>how.</i><br> <br>In summary, my teaching is based on <i>what, why</i>, and <i>how</i>. I teach <i>da Tao zhi jian</i> (pronounced <i>dah dow jr jyen</i>), which means <i>the Big Way is extremely simple</i>. The simplest wisdom and techniques are the best. Simple is powerful. I am the servant of humanity. I love simplicity.<br> <br>Billions of people need healing.<br> <br>Billions of people need transformation of relationships.<br> <br>Billions of people need transformation of finances.<br> <br>Billions of people need rejuvenation.<br> <br>Billions of people need to purify their souls, hearts, minds, and bodies.<br> <br>Billions of people need to increase their intelligence.<br> <br>Billions of people need to open their hearts and souls.<br> <br>Billions of people need to apply love, forgiveness, compassion, and light to transform themselves, humanity, Mother Earth, and all souls.<br> <br>Billions of people need to join hearts and souls together to transform Mother Earth&#x2019;s transition and to bring love, peace, and harmony to humanity, Mother Earth, and all universes.<br> <br>Complexity cannot serve billions of people and all souls. Simplicity is the way to serve billions of people and all souls.<br> <br>I am a servant of humanity and countless souls. Ever since I wrote my first book the Divine has guided me that simplicity is the key to service. <i>What, why</i>, and <i>how</i> is the way to write, teach, and serve every aspect of my life. <i>What, why</i>, and <i>how</i> is the way to serve every aspect of your life.<br> <br><b></b><b>What Are Divine Healing Hands?</b><br> <br>Divine Healing Hands are God&#x2019;s soul hands. God creates his new soul hands and transmits them to the chosen ones through the service of a Divine Channel (one of my Worldwide Representatives or me). <i>Chosen one</i> means a person who has gone through the process of applying for, receiving approval by Divine Guidance, and registering to receive Divine Healing Hands.<br> <br>The Divine chose me as a servant of humanity and the Divine in July 2003 and gave me the honor and authority to download or transmit permanent divine treasures to humanity. In 2011 about twenty of my Worldwide Representatives, who are also Divine Channels, received the honor and authority to download Divine Healing Hands. If you are not a Divine Channel, you cannot download Divine Healing Hands to others. To download Divine Healing Hands is an honor beyond words, comprehension, and imagination. Divine Channels are divine presence on Mother Earth. They are divine servants to represent the Divine to serve humanity, Mother Earth, and all souls.<br> <br>The Divine Healing Hands treasure created by the Divine is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet wide. Once the Divine Healing Hands treasure is downloaded to a chosen one, it takes two or three days for the divine treasure to shrink to a condensed size, which is two or three times the size of the recipient&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>After one receives Divine Healing Hands, the recipient receives proper training from a Divine Channel to become certified as a Divine Healing Hands Soul Healer.<br> <br>When a Divine Healing Hands Soul Healer offers a soul healing blessing, the Divine Healing Hands treasure will come out from the Divine Healing Hands Soul Healer to serve the recipient. Divine Healing Hands Soul Healers can offer soul healing blessings in person and remotely. They can offer healing blessings one on one or to a group of people. There is no limit to the number of people who can receive soul healing blessings from Divine Healing Hands.<br> <br><b></b><b>Why Do Divine Healing Hands Work?</b><br> <br>Why does a person become sick? Sickness is due to soul mind body blockages.<br> <br>Soul blockages are bad karma. Karma is the record of services from one&#x2019;s previous lifetimes and this lifetime. Karma is divided into good karma and bad karma. Good karma is accumulated from one&#x2019;s good service offered in all lifetimes, including love, care, compassion, sincerity, honesty, generosity, kindness, integrity, purity, and more.<br> <br>Bad karma is accumulated from the mistakes one has made in all lifetimes, including killing, harming, taking advantage of others, cheating, stealing, lying, and more.<br> <br>As I noted in the introduction, there is a karmic law in Heaven:<br> <br>Good service brings rewards.<br> <br>Bad service brings lessons.<br> <br>This law applies to all souls in all universes. There is an ancient saying: <i>Heaven is most fair.</i> No good deed goes unnoticed. No bad deed goes unnoticed.<br> <br>The Divine chose me as a servant of humanity and the Divine in July 2003. The Divine gave me the honor and authority to offer Divine Karma Cleansing and Divine Soul Mind Body Transplants to humanity.<br> <br>What is Divine Karma Cleansing? Divine Karma Cleansing means the Divine offers divine forgiveness by paying one&#x2019;s spiritual debt and clearing one&#x2019;s bad karma.<br> <br>When one has bad karma, one could learn lessons in any aspect of life, including health, relationships, finances, business, children, and more. There is only one way to self-clear bad karma: serve others unconditionally. To serve others is to make others happier and healthier. To serve unconditionally is to serve without asking for or expecting anything in return.<br> <br>If one has heavy bad karma it could take thirty to fifty years of unconditional universal service in one lifetime to remove the bad karma and to be forgiven. It could take many lifetimes of unconditional universal service to remove one&#x2019;s heavy bad karma.<br> <br>Bad karma is spiritual debt. It must be paid. How is it paid? Normally it is paid by learning one&#x2019;s karmic lessons&#x2014;blockages in one&#x2019;s health, relationships, finances, business, and any aspect of life. Divine Karma Cleansing means the Divine gives his virtue, which is spiritual currency, to pay one&#x2019;s spiritual debt. This is divine generosity. If one has bad karma, there are dark blockages inside the body. When the Divine offers virtue, the darkness will leave the body. The darkness is the root cause of sickness, broken relationships, financial challenges, and more.<br> <br>I and my more than twenty Worldwide Representatives, who, like me, are also divine servants, vehicles, and channels, have offered tens of thousands of Divine Karma Cleansings for humanity. We have received thousands of heart-touching and moving soul healing stories and soul healing miracles from Divine Karma Cleansing. In the last three years, nearly one thousand heart-touching and moving stories have been video recorded and posted on my YouTube channel, YouTube.com/zhigangsha. I encourage you to view some of them. In addition, you will read stories related to Divine Healing Hands throughout this book. Divine Healing Hands blessings can remove bad karma little by little.<br> <br>In one sentence:<br> <br>To clear soul blockages is to remove the darkness inside the body.<br> <br>The second cause of sickness is mind blockages, which include negative mind-sets, negative beliefs, negative attitudes, ego, attachments, and more. Millions of people have all types of mind blockages.<br> <br>The third cause of sickness is body blockages, which are energy and matter blockages.<br> <br>In ancient spiritual teaching a human being has three internal treasures: jing qi shen. Jing is <i>matter</i>. Qi (pronounced <i>chee</i>) is <i>vital energy or life force</i>. Shen is <i>soul</i>.<br> <br>Jing qi shen is soul, mind, and body. To remove soul mind body blockages is to remove blockages in jing qi shen. Soul mind body and jing qi shen are different ways to express the same thing. &#x201c;Jing qi shen&#x201d; is the ancient term. &#x201c;Soul mind body&#x201d; is the new term for the Soul Light Era.<br> <br>Why do Divine Healing Hands work? In one sentence:<br> <br>Divine Healing Hands remove soul mind body blockages, which are blockages in the jing qi shen of the body, for healing and rejuvenation, and remove soul mind body blockages in relationships, finances, children, intelligence, and more in order to transform every aspect of life.<br> <br>Divine Healing Hands carry divine power, which includes:<br> <br> ï¿½ divine frequency and vibration, which can transform the frequency and vibration of all life, including health, relationships, finances, business, children, and every aspect of life<br> <br> ï¿½ divine love, which melts all blockages and transforms all life<br> <br> ï¿½ divine forgiveness, which brings inner joy and inner peace to all life<br> <br> ï¿½ divine compassion, which boosts energy, stamina, vitality, and immunity of all life<br> <br> ï¿½ divine light, which heals, prevents sickness, purifies and rejuvenates soul, heart, mind, and body, and transforms health, relationships, finances, intelligence, and every aspect of life<br> <br>Words are not enough to express the power of Divine Healing Hands.<br> <br>Thoughts are not enough to express the significance of Divine Healing Hands.<br> <br>Imagination is not enough to express the honor of receiving Divine Healing Hands.<br> <br>How blessed we are that the Divine is giving his soul hands to the chosen ones to empower them to serve as divine healers. Anyone who can receive Divine Healing Hands cannot express enough the honor, appreciation, and blessing of being a Divine Healing Hands Soul Healer.<br> <br>I always teach: <i>If you want to know if a pear is sweet, taste it. If you want to know if Divine Healing Hands are powerful, experience it.</i><br> <br>This story is a taste of the pear:<br> <br><i>I am an acupuncturist in Honolulu, Hawaii, specializing in treating infertility and the prevention of miscarriage. Recently one of my patients who was thirteen weeks pregnant with twins (after more than five years of trying to conceive) began bleeding heavily upon awakening one morning. Her obstetrician told her that there was nothing they could do and that she should just stay home and rest.</i><br> <br><i>She called me immediately after speaking with her doctor. At that time I was unable to go to her house, so I offered her a remote Divine Healing Hands blessing with guided self-healing for about thirty minutes. Two hours</i> <i>later, she got up and the bleeding had slowed considerably. Five hours later I called her and we went through another session of Divine Healing Hands blessing along with guided self-healing by applying the Four Power Techniques and a forgiveness practice.</i><br> <br><i>I asked her to remain lying down until the next morning when she would have an ultrasound. By the time she went to bed that evening, the bleeding appeared to have stopped. Indeed, there was no more bleeding after that and the ultrasound the next day showed that both fetuses were in good health!</i><br> <br><i>She continues to do a daily forgiveness practice and comes to see me once a week. She is now in her twentieth week of pregnancy, and just had an ultrasound that revealed she is carrying two healthy baby boys!</i><br> <br><i>Thank you, Divine, Tao, and Master Sha. Thank you for the power of Divine Healing Hands and other divine treasures. I am extremely grateful.</i><br> <br><i>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</i><br> <br><i>Love you. Love you.

All proceeds benefit the Oro Valley Public Library.</p><p>Displaying an artist's sensitivity, an editor's skill, and a camera's perceptive eye, Liberman's 1960 classic, The Artist in His Studio , presented a singular image of the great artists working in France during the 20th century. Twenty-eight years later, he offers a revised and expanded edition, strengthening his contribution to the world of art by adding material to some sections and enlarging the number of artists. Liberman's empathy and erudition, enhanced by fine reproduction quality, is exemplified by his intimate conversations with many of the artists, sensitive shots of the surroundings in which they created, and keen understanding of the creative process. Matisse's hand, a pensive Giacometti, the meticulous line of tools laid out by Braqueall are photographic witness to an intimacy pierced by the author's vision.

King, Jerry Garcia, Chet Atkins, and many others. Yet there is no major biography of Reinhardt. <br> Now, in <em>Django</em>, Michael Dregni offers a definitive portrait of this great guitarist. Handsome, charismatic, childlike, and unpredictable, Reinhardt was a character out of a picaresque novel. Born in a gypsy caravan at a crossroads in Belgium, he was almost killed in a freak fire that burned half of his body and left his left hand twisted into a claw. But with this maimed left hand flying over the frets and his right hand plucking at dizzying speed, Django became Europe's most famous jazz musician, commanding exorbitant fees--and spending the money as fast as he made it. Dregni not only chronicles this remarkably colorful life--including a fascinating account of gypsy culture--but he also sheds much light on Django's musicianship. He examines his long musical partnership with violinist Stï¿½phane Grappelli--the one suave and smooth, the other sharper and more dissonant--and he traces the evolution of their novel string jazz ensemble, <em>Quintette du Hot Club de France</em>. Indeed, the author spotlights Django's amazing musical diversity, describing his swing-styled Nouveau Quintette, his big band Django's Music, and his later bebop ensemble, as well as his many compositions, including symphonic pieces influenced by Ravel and Debussy and his unfinished organ mass inspired by Bach. And along the way, the author offers vivid snapshots of the jazz scene in Paris--colorful portraits of Josephine Baker, Bricktop, Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, and countless others--and of Django's vagabond wanderings around France, Europe, and the United States, where he toured with Duke Ellington. <br> Capturing the extraordinary life and times of one of the great musicians of the twentieth century, <em>Django</em> is a must-read portrait of a true original.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Dregni</strong> is a writer for <em>Vintage Guitar</em> magazine; his work has also appeared in Acoustic Guitar, Guitar Player, and <em>The Utne Reader</em>, among other publications. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<br><br>"One of the most satisfying jazz biographies in recent years.... Dregni writes lyrically of a place where the crosscurrents of art, music and fashion collided to produce a cultural richness that happens only once or twice a century, if humans are lucky.... Rich and rewarding."--<em>Baltimore Sun</em><p></p><br>"In many ways the book jazz enthusiasts have been waiting for.... Fascinating and well-written. Dregni's musical analysis will send fans running to the stereo, digging out the old recordings and listening with fresh ears. Guitarists will have a feast reading about Django's technique and his famous Selmer Maccaferri guitar. Although Django will always be a larger-than-life figure, Dregni has given us a much clearer picture of the man behind the myth. 'Django' is, for now, the definitive biography, and we are in Dregni's debt for considerably advancing our understanding of the remarkable Django Reinhardt, his music and the world he lived in."--David French, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Extremely informative.... An important appreciation of an oft-forgotten musician.... Dregni carefully dissects Reinhardt's virtuoso playing style without resorting to technical jargon, and he spends plenty of time tending to Reinhardt's passionate soul--artistic, gypsy and otherwise."--Mitch Myers, <em>DownBeat</em><p></p><br>"A compelling portrait of this colorful musician, one that gives equal time to Reinhardt's fascinating story as well as ample musical analysis."--<em>JazzTimes</em><p></p><br>"Dregni's biography does his complex subject justice.... His immersion in the period's history enriches his storytelling and our understanding. The panoramic results present Django Reinhardt as he has never been seen.... Dregni clarifies a lot of history while weaving an illumniated web of contexts around his subject. He vividly describes Gypsy life and mores, and anti-Gypsy bigotry; unearths new aspects of Reinhardt's life and work; discusses Parisian musette, American 'hot' jazz and bebop, and classical music; and insightfully details the music Reinhardt made and the instruments and people he made it with."--Gene Santoro, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"There was only one Django Reinhardt, and Dregni supplies a vivid, detailed portrait of the man behind the guitar.... Dregni has given us Reinhardt the man--rascal, scoundrel, transcendent improviser, failed human being."--Joel Selvin, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"An encyclopedic account of the Gypsy jazzman's life and times that provides an abundance of new information, finds new connections between what was already known, and clears up many misconceptions along the way."--<em>Guitar Player</em><p></p><br>"A rags-to-riches story of a unique talent whose works continue to touch aspiring guitarists of all genres."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"The great strength of his book is his tireless research into the world of Django's gypsy roots. He has tracked down and interviewed as many of Reinhardt's relatives as he can find, as well as older gypsies who knew and worked with him. The result is a more complete portrait of Reinhardt's inner life, including his relationships with his parents, his wife and many other women, and two sons. There is even a detailed account of the tragic fire that cost him two fingers.... <em>Django</em> is a remarkable book, and its outsider's perspective is part of the reason."--<em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"The book is alive from beginning to end, and after awhile you feel like you were there as Django's career unfolds. Dregni insures that the story behind the music will not fade. Musicians, guitarists, students of the history of WWII, and those who love a good biography will love this book."--Frank Forte, <em>Just Jazz Guitar</em><p></p><br>"Dregni...not only has managed to break into the French milieu of jazz aficionados and sects in which Django worked but has penetrated the Gypsy, or Romany, world from which Django emerged--a clannish world whose existence, well into the nineteen-fifties and sixties, was still largely furtive, outdoors, vagabond, and, occasionally, criminal. Dregni clears up the two much mystified areas of Django's life--what exactly he did during the Second World War, and what really happened on his one trip to America, in 1946--and he sorts through the music and, nice bonus, manages to suggest plots for at least three fine French movie musicals."--Adam Gopnik, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Recently I roamed the streets of Paris carrying 'Django: The Life and Music of a Gypsy Legend,' a new biography by Michael Dregni. It was my guidebook to a city the great musician knew like the neck of his guitar, from the seedy, smoke-filled dives of Pigalle to the fancy, cafe-society quarter around the Etoile... With a little imagination, Django cultists can still feel his presence in the City of Light."--Susan Spano, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"In this carefully researched biography, rich with details from interviews with family members, friends and musicians, Dregni brings legendary Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt into the spotlight.... Dregni casts Django as a mercurial, charismatic Romany innocent, alternately transfixed by dajo life and dismissive of it. Colorful descriptions of the nightclubs of jazz-age Paris and sensitive appraisals of Django's musicianship add to the book's appeal."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Uncovers the influences that helped fuse Reinhardt's unique talent and background with a developing music scene that would eventually become a lasting art form."--<em>Vintage Guitar Magazine</em><p></p><br></p><h2>When the Sun Rose</h2><p>An imaginative little girl spends a happy day with her playmate, who arrives with a pet lion</p><p>Barbara Helen Berger lives on Bainbridge Island, Washington.Kindergarten-Grade 3 While the action can be described in only one sentence (a friend visits a little girl for an afternoon of tea, playing dolls, and painting rainbows), many lines are needed to convey the activity in these boldly-colored illustrations. The warm glow of the yellows of a carriage made from a rose, the lion pulling it, and a dress made from yellow roses achieves luminescence on paper, heightened by the intense greens, reds, and blues of the countryside and playhouse. The yellow changes to rich gold as the sun sets. The variation in picture size, from small close-ups of the dolls to elongated spreads, adds flow to the day's happening and lends a cinematic quality. The combination of vibrant colors, strong composition, and margin motif together frame a sensation, like a daydream visualized. That the friend may be imagined only adds to the book's appeal. As with Berger's previous books, Grandfather Twilight (1984) and Donkey's Dream (1985, both Philomel) , this picture book provides a vivid showcase for a simple story.

This enthralling visionary trilogy is, as Penelope Fitzgerald remarks in her introduction, a "strange masterpiece," and one of the unsung glories of modern literature.</p><p>L.H. (Leopold Hamilton) Myers is the author of <i>The Orissers</i> (1923), <i>The Clio</i> (1925), Strange Glory (1936), and The Pool of Vishnu (1940), which was intended to complete the story told in <i>The Root and the Flower</i>. The son of a founding member of the Society for Psychical Research, Myers was deeply concerned with issues of spiritual transcendence and social justice; briefly active with the Bloomsbury Group, he later rejected what he judged the members&#x2019; insufficient regard for spiritual matters. He committed suicide in 1944.<br><br>Penelope Fitzgerald (1916-2000) graduated with honors from Somerville College, Oxford, and worked at a variety of jobs until, in 1975, she published her first book, a biography of the pre-Raphaelite master Edward Burne-Jones. She was the author of two other biographies and ten works of fiction, among them <i>The Blue Flower</i>, <i>Human Voices</i>, and <i>The Bookshop</i>.The Root and the Flower, British writer L.H. Myers's strange, mystical historical trilogy, was first published in the 1930s, and will now be reissued in one volume with an introduction by Penelope Fitzgerald. Set in a dreamlike version of Moghal India, it follows the adventures of a prince, his wife and their son Jali, each struggling separately with temptation and spiritual malaise. Lyrically written and exquisitely imagined, it is a haunting minor classic. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Communion: A Culinary Journey Through Vietnam</h2><p><p>Living in Vietnam for four years in the 1990s, Seattle native Kim Fay fell in love with the romantic landscapes, the rich culture, and the uninhibited warmth of the people.

Ernesto is a sixteen-year-old boy from an educated family who lives with his mother in Trieste. His mother is eager for him to get ahead and has asked a local businessman to give him some workplace experience in his warehouse. One day a workingman makes advances to Ernesto, who responds with willing curiosity. A month of trysts ensues before the boy begins to tire of the relationship, finally escaping it altogether by engineering his own dismissal. And yet his experience has changed him, and as Umberto Saba&#x2019;s unfinished, autobiographical story breaks off, Ernesto has struck up a new, oddly romantic attachment to a boy his own age.</p><p><b>Umberto Saba</b> (1883&#x2013;1957) was born Umberto Poli in the city of Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and continued to live in Trieste for the greater part of his life. The child of a broken family&#x2014;his father, who had converted to Judaism to marry, soon abandoned his wife&#x2014;Saba attended the Imperial Academy of Commerce and Navigation in Trieste, and then moved for some years to Pisa, where he studied classical languages and archaeology. In 1909 he married Carolina Wï¿½lfler, also Jewish, and the subsequent year she gave birth to a daughter; a first book of poems, published under the name of Umberto Saba, also appeared that year. Saba&#x2019;s marriage was at first troubled&#x2014;his wife&#x2019;s affair with a painter led to a brief separation&#x2014;and the couple was poor, and for a few years they moved around Italy in the hopes of improving their fortunes. After the end of World War I, however, Saba bought a secondhand bookshop in Trieste&#x2014;he called it La Libreria Antica e Moderna&#x2014;and in the next decades he made a comfortable living as a bookdealer while working on <i>Il Canzoniere</i>, the book of poems he published in 1921 and would go on adding to for the rest of his life. During World War II, Saba and his family were forced to flee Trieste and go into hiding in Florence to avoid deportation by the Nazis. Though the postwar years brought him many prizes and widespread recognition as one of modern Italy&#x2019;s greatest poets, Saba suffered from depression, which had plagued him all his life, and opium addiction and was repeatedly institutionalized. He died at seventy-four, within a year of his wife.<br><br><b>Estelle Gilson</b> is a writer, translator, and poet.

What sets <i>Ernesto</i> apart (and Saba&#x2019;s prose) is the equanimity, the sparkling irony of the sensibility with which he greets this unexpected turn in his life...a lovely, bright, wise fragment that by comparison makes most other adolescent sex-memory fiction read like drying cement." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Spare, realistic prose that...manages to convey great emotion and deep thought simultaneously...should gain [Saba] some of the recognition already won by his friends and fellow Italian writers Carlo Levi and Eugenio Montale." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"From this skeletal account, one may derive the main elements of the story, and the key images and preoccupations, from which Saba would build his poems: the errant father, the lost paradise of Peppa&#x2019;s house, the city of Trieste, the innocent and then tormented love for his wife, melancholy, solitude, and sexual desire, including some lightly sketched yearning for boys.... Saba inherited the mixture of Romantic plangency and Classical stoicism that gave his own work its peculiar timbre." &#x2014;Rosanna Warren, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"He saunters through every street of Trieste, catching glimpses of the city&#x2019;s manifold forms of life; his sky holds a little cloud that has haunted him from childhood...a certain crisp exactitude....

September had already begun, and still every day the temperature climbed into the nineties. The threat of forest fires remained. A trickle of sweat beaded up on the tip of his nose. He wiped it off. One of these days he would get the air-conditioning fixed on the Explorer. So far that summer, Blight County had managed to escape any major fires, but the mountains were powder dry. Any spark could set them off. He didn&#x2019;t want to think what would happen should a thunderstorm roll through. Or if his father, Pap Tully, went for a hike in the mountains smoking one of his hand-rolleds.</p><p>Tully was wearing his usual summer outfit of Levi&#x2019;s, long-sleeve tattersall shirt open at the collar, three-thousand-dollar alligator-hide cowboy boots, and a light khaki vest, which concealed the horizontal shoulder holster containing his 9 mm Colt Commander automatic. Today the gun seemed to weigh at least ten pounds. He preferred a lighter weapon, but criminals had become much more dangerous in recent years. He didn&#x2019;t believe in shooting a criminal more than twice in the body mass&#x2014;the so-called double tap.</p><p>A roofed porch spread across the front of the sprawling ranch house. A man sat in a rocking chair on the porch. He had the brim of a battered cowboy hat pulled low over his eyes. Tully couldn&#x2019;t tell whether he was asleep or watching the vehicle approach. The man would know the red Ford Explorer belonged to law enforcement because of the light bar on the roof. He obviously was the alleged culprit the ranch owner&#x2019;s ex-wife had complained about.</p><p>Tully stopped the Explorer in front of the house. The man pushed the brim of his hat up with his thumb and sauntered down to greet him. He took off his hat as he approached. He appeared to be in his early thirties, slender, nice-looking, a tidy person, with short hair, a trim mustache, and under his lower lip, a tiny bush of brown hair. Tully got out of his vehicle and walked around to meet him. He stuck out his hand and said, &#x201c;Howdy, pardner, I&#x2019;m Blight County sheriff Bo Tully.&#x201d;</p><p>The man shook his hand. &#x201c;Shucks, Sheriff, I know who you are. You&#x2019;re the most famous person in all Blight County.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That tells you something about Blight County, doesn&#x2019;t it? I take it you&#x2019;re Ray Crockett.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, that&#x2019;s me, Sheriff. No doubt Marge Poulson told you how I done away with Orville.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She has indeed. Numerous times. So what do you have to say for yourself, Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>Crockett scratched his head. &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s see. I have to admit I haven&#x2019;t seen or heard from Orville in several months. His Social Security check arrives every month, and I mail it to a P.O. box in Spokane. Somebody picks up the checks&#x2014;Orville, I suppose&#x2014;and probably cashes them. That post office box would be pretty full by now if nobody picked up the checks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sounds like a reasonable guess. How long have you been mailing his checks to Spokane?&#x201d;</p><p>Crockett squinted up, as if looking for the answer in the sky. &#x201c;Quite a while. Going on a couple of years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have an address or phone number for Orville?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope, I don&#x2019;t. He travels a lot and stays in hotels. He used to call me every couple weeks or so, but now months go by I don&#x2019;t hear from him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you do for a living, Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>Crockett put his hat back on. &#x201c;Not much, Sheriff. Orville lets me stay here free of charge to look after the ranch, but he sold off all the stock so there&#x2019;s not much to look after. I helped him sell the stock and he gave me five percent of the gross. I put my share in a CD. Then my dad died and I got a bit of insurance money. That&#x2019;s mostly what I&#x2019;ve been living on.&#x201d; He gestured toward the ranch house. &#x201c;This is a nice place to live and I guess I&#x2019;ll stay here till Orville tells me different or my money runs out. I&#x2019;m not one of those people consumed by ambition but lately I been thinking about taking some courses at the community college. Do something with my life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have a major in mind?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking maybe law.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never can tell when that might come in handy. So, any other plans, Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t made up my mind yet. I guess I&#x2019;ll stick on here until Marge gets on my nerves so much I can&#x2019;t stand it. Small wonder Orville divorced her! Grab a seat up on the porch, Sheriff, and I&#x2019;ll go fetch us each a beer.&#x201d;</p><p>Tully pursed his lips, as if considering the offer. &#x201c;Sounds mighty tempting, Ray, but I&#x2019;ve got to get moving on. Give me the address of that Spokane mailbox, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure thing. I have to go in the house to get it. My memory&#x2019;s like a sieve.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mine too. Write it down for me, would you, Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>Tully looked around at the farm buildings. He made out a large boat in an open shed and behind it a barn that had probably once been cadmium red but now had faded with age into a weathered burnt sienna. No, that wasn&#x2019;t quite it. Tully felt the urge to give up on law enforcement once and for all and start painting full-time.</p><p>Crockett returned with the mailbox address written down on a piece of blue-lined paper apparently torn out of a small notebook. He handed it to Tully.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Ray. I&#x2019;ll check it out. Maybe that will satisfy Marge and get her off my back. Maybe even off your back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be nice.&#x201d; Crockett&#x2019;s thumb stroked the bit of fuzz under his lip. &#x201c;If I can be of any more help, Sheriff, let me know. The next time Orville calls, I&#x2019;ll have him get in touch. The last I heard from him, though, he said he was headed down to Mexico.

He was in great shape the last time I saw him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You a fisherman, Ray?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, afraid not. Fishing is one of the few vices I&#x2019;ve never tried. Why do you ask?&#x201d;</p><p>Tully pointed at the boat.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that. It belongs to Orville. He used to spend a lot of time out on Lake Blight. Said he knew the lake like the back of his hand. He was always bringing home messes of fish. Don&#x2019;t ask what kind because I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s about the biggest Boston Whaler I&#x2019;ve ever seen.

In his rearview mirror he watched Crockett return to his chair and tilt the hat down over his eyes, apparently to resume his nap. He appeared to be a nice young man, polite, attentive, respectful. In other words, a classic sociopath. He lied as smoothly as if he were telling the truth. Marge was right. Ray killed the old man. The questions were, what did he do with the body, and how does he cash Orville&#x2019;s Social Security checks?</p><p>A fly walked across the inside of his windshield. He decided to let it live.

Here the reader will encounter the treasures of Pre-Hispanic Mexico, as on a tour, with the Museum&#39;s Director as guide through its splendors. They range from the most ancient traces of primitive civilizations to the most polished examples of 16th-century Aztec culture - from the pre-Classical small figures and pottery of the 12-century B.C., and the urns, frescoes and colossal statues of the Classical period, to the ceremonial dishes, ornaments and giant votive tablets of the Post-Classical period, when the Spanish Conquistadors first set foot in the new world of Mexico. From Tlatilco comes one of the earliest and most original creations of representational art in the Valley of Mexico, the &#39;Kneeling Woman Kissing a Dog&#39; - a small masterpiece, highly personal, amazingly sophisticated in composition. From the Olmec culture comes the &#39;Group of Figures&#39;, composed of sixteen standing male statuettes, an exceptionally impressive tableau, shown here in a magnificent double spread. Here also are the Classical period &#39;Seated Woman&#39;, a 5th century figure of sovereign authority representing the goddess of fertility - sensual in its palpitating play of light and shade; and the figure of &#39;The God Tlaloc&#39;, innocent and refined, pouring down on earth the beneficent water that will nourish the crops. The genius of later Mexican art is seen in the 14th-century &#39;Flower Prince&#39;, a sacred portrait of Xochipilli, the Aztec god of spring, love, poetry and dance, which combines floral elements with geometric simplicity; the &#39;Crouching Rabbit&#39;, an exquisite rock-crystal sculpture of exceptional balance and compact stylization; and, to highlight the collection, the giant &#39;Sun Stone&#39;, representing the history of the world - abstract, occult, and full of the fire and movement of the Aztec universe.</p><p></p><h2>Les Bravades: A Portfolio of Pictures Made for Rebecca Welles by Her Father</h2><p>An illustrated retelling of the Bravade festival held in St. Tropez consists of sketches made by Orson Welles for his daughter in 1956</p><p>George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 &#x2013; October 10, 1985) was an Academy Award-winning American director, writer, actor and producer for film, stage, radio and television. Welles first gained wide notoriety for his October 30, 1938, radio broadcast of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. Adapted to sound like a contemporary news broadcast, it caused a number of listeners to panic. In the mid-1930s, his New York theatre adaptations of an all-black voodoo Macbeth and a contemporary allegorical Julius Caesar became legendary. Welles was also an accomplished magician, starring in troop variety spectacles in the war years. During this period he became a serious political activist and commentator through journalism, radio and public appearances closely associated with Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1941, he co-wrote, directed, produced and starred in Citizen Kane, often chosen in polls of film critics as the greatest film ever made. The rest of his career was often obstructed by lack of funds, incompetent studio interference and other unfortunate occurrences, both during exile in Europe and brief returns to Hollywood. Despite these difficulties Othello won the 1952 Grand Prix du Festival International du Film at the Cannes Film Festival and Touch of Evil won the top prize at the Brussels World Fair, while Welles himself considered The Trial and Chimes at Midnight to be the best of his efforts. Although Welles remained on the margins of the major studios as a director/producer, his larger-than-life personality made him a bankable actor. In his later years he struggled against a Hollywood system that refused to finance his independent film projects, making a living largely through acting, commercials, and voice-over work. Welles received a 1975 American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement award, the third person to do so after John Ford and James Cagney. Critical appreciation for Welles has increased since his death. He is now widely acknowledged as one of the most important dramatic artists of the 20th century: in 2002 he was voted as the greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute's poll of Top Ten Directors</p><h2>Three Parts Dead (Craft Sequence)</h2><p><p>"Sharp, original, passionate." &#x2015;NPR</p><p><b>The first novel in the critically acclaimed contemporary fantasy series by Max Gladstone</b></p><br><p><b>A god has died, and it's up to Tara, first-year associate in the international necromantic firm of Kelethres, Albrecht, and Ao, to bring Him back to life before His city falls apart.</b></p><p>Her client is Kos, recently deceased fire god of the city of Alt Coulumb.

He lives in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>When the Hidden Schools threw Tara Abernathy out, she fell a thousand feet through wisps of cloud and woke to find herself alive, broken and bleeding, beside the Crack in the World. <br>By the grace of fortune (or something else), she landed three mere miles from what passed for an oasis in the Badlands, a stand of rough grass and brambles clustered around a brackish spring. She couldn&#x2019;t walk, but made the crawl by sunrise. Caked with dirt and dried blood, she dragged herself over sand and thorn to the muddy pool at the oasis&#x2019;s heart. She drank desperately of the water, and to pull herself from death&#x2019;s brink she also drank the life of that desolate place. Grass withered beneath her clutching fingers. Scrub bushes shrank to desiccated husks. The oasis died around her and she crumpled to the arid earth, wracked with wounds and deep illness. <br>Dream visions tore at one another in her fever, lent strength and form by her proximity to the Crack. She saw other worlds where the God Wars never happened, where iron ruled and men flew without magic. <br>When Tara regained consciousness the oasis was dead, its spring dry, grass and brambles ground to dust. She lived. She remembered her name. She remembered her Craft. Her last two months in the Hidden Schools seemed like a twisted hallucination, but they were real. The glyphs tattooed on her arms and between her breasts proved she had studied there, above the clouds, and the glyph below her collarbone meant they really did graduate her before they kicked her out. <br>She fought them, of course, with shadow and lightning&#x2014;fought and lost. As her professors held her squirming over empty space, she remembered a soft, unexpected touch&#x2014;a woman&#x2019;s hand sliding into her pocket, an alto whisper before gravity took hold. &#x201c;If you survive this, I&#x2019;ll find you.&#x201d; Then the fall. <br>Squinting against the sun, Tara drew from the pocket of her torn slacks an eggshell-white business card that bore the name &#x201c;Elayne Kevarian&#x201d; above the triangular logo of Kelethras, Albrecht, and Ao, one of the world&#x2019;s most prestigious Craft firms. Professors and students at the Hidden Schools whispered the woman&#x2019;s name&#x2014;and the firm&#x2019;s&#x2014;in fear and awe. <br>A job offer? Unlikely, considering the circumstances, and even if so, Tara was not inclined to accept. The world of Craft had not been kind to her of late. <br>Regardless, her priorities were clear. Food, first. Shelter. Regain strength. Then, perhaps, think about the future. <br>Good plan. <br>She collapsed. <br>Silence settled over the Badlands. <br>A buzzard descended from the dry blue sky in tightening circles, like a wood chip in a draining pool. It landed beside her body, hopped forward. No heartbeat audible; cooling flesh. Convinced, it bent its head and opened its beak. <br>Tara&#x2019;s hand twitched up fast as a cobra and wrung the bird&#x2019;s neck before it could flee. The other gathering buzzards took the hint and wheeled to safety, but one bird cooked inexpertly over a fire of dry grass and twigs was more than enough to set a half-starved girl on her feet. <br>Four weeks later she arrived on the outskirts of Edgemont, gaunt and sun-blasted, seeing things that did not precisely exist. Her mother found her collapsed near their cattle fence. A lot of crying followed her discovery, and a lot of shouting, and more crying after the shouting, and then a lot of soup. Edgemont mothers were renowned for their practicality, and Ma Abernathy in particular had iron faith in the restorative powers of chicken broth. <br>Tara&#x2019;s father was understanding, considering the circumstances. <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re back,&#x201d; he said, a concerned expression on his broad face. He did not ask where she had been for the last eight years, or what happened there, or how she earned her scars. Tara would have thanked him for that had she known how. There were too many ways he could have said &#x201c;I told you so.&#x201d; <br>That evening the Abernathy family sat around their kitchen table and settled on the story they would tell the other residents of Edgemont: When Tara left home at sixteen, she signed on with a traveling merchant, from whom she learned the fundamentals of Craft. The Hidden Schools never opened themselves to her, and at last, tired of dust and long wandering, she returned home. It was a good enough lie, and explained Tara&#x2019;s undeniable skill with contracts and bargains without stirring up any of the local fear of true Craftswomen. <br>Tara put the business card from her mind. The people of Edgemont needed her, though they would have chased her from town if they knew where she learned to use her talents. Ned Thorpe lost half the profit from his lemon crop every year, due to a bad arbitration clause in his reseller&#x2019;s contract. Ghosts stole dead men&#x2019;s bequests through loopholes in poorly written wills. Tara offered her services tentatively at first, but soon she had to refuse work. She was a productive citizen. Shopkeeps came to her to draft their pacts, farmers for help investing the scraps of soulstuff they eked out of the dry soil. <br>Over time she picked up the pieces of her childhood, hot cocoa and pitching horseshoes on the front lawn. It was easier than she expected to reacclimate herself to a country life without much Craft. Indoor plumbing was a luxury again. When summer came, she and her parents sat outside in the breeze or inside with windows shut and shades drawn to ward off heat. When cold wind blew they built fires with wood and flint. No elementals of air were summoned to fan the brow, no fiery dancers cavorted to warm cold halls. At school she had condemned such a life as simple, provincial, boring, but words like &#x201c;simple,&#x201d; &#x201c;provincial,&#x201d; and &#x201c;boring&#x201d; did not seem so pejorative to her now. <br>Once, she nearly took a lover, after a solstice dance on the village green. Staggering back tipsy and arm-in-arm with a boy she barely remembered from her days in Edgemont&#x2019;s two-room school, who had grown into a young man tending his family&#x2019;s sheep, she stopped to rest on a swell of ground and watch the stars in the fleeting summer night. The young man sat next to her and watched with her, but when he touched her face and the small of her back she pulled away, apologized, and left. <br>The days were long, and safe, but she felt something wither inside her as she lingered there. The world beyond Edgemont, the world of Craft more profound than a farmer&#x2019;s spring planting and the mending of small cuts and bruises, faded and began to seem unreal. Her memories of the Hidden Schools acquired the cotton haze of dream, and she woke once or twice from nightmares in which she had never left home at all. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The Raiders struck at night, three months after the solstice. Swift and savage, they took little, but at dawn three of Edgemont&#x2019;s watchmen lay on the field of battle, shrunken in death by a clinging curse that corroded anything that drew near. The villagers lifted the bodies on long spears of cold iron and buried them in a blessed grave. The chaplain said a few words, and as Edgemont bowed its collective head Tara watched him weave the town&#x2019;s faith into a net, taking from each man or woman what little soulstuff he or she could afford and binding it close about the loose earth. He was no Craftsman, but his Applied Theology was sound as such things went. <br>Tara was the last to leave the grave. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how we&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201d; Father stood alone by their hearth after the funeral and before the wake, the whiskey in his glass the same color as their small early autumn fire. &#x201c;They were good boys, and well trained. Held off the Raiders for years. We&#x2019;ll have to hire others, but we can&#x2019;t spare the price.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can help.&#x201d; <br>He looked back at her, and she saw a splinter of fear in his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a fighter, Tara.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;But I can do more than fight.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll manage.&#x201d; His tone left no avenue for appeal. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve managed before.&#x201d; <br>She did not challenge him, but she thought: <i>The chaplain&#x2019;s skills are antiquated. He struggles to keep the village safe. What&#x2019;s the use of all I&#x2019;ve learned, if I can&#x2019;t protect the people I care about?</i> <br>Her father turned from the fireplace and fixed her with his steady gaze. &#x201c;Tara, promise me you won&#x2019;t&nbsp;&#x2026; intervene.&#x201d; <br>Over the last few months Tara had learned that the best lies were lies not told. &#x201c;Dad. Do you think I&#x2019;m stupid?&#x201d; <br>He frowned, but said no more. This suited Tara, because she would not have promised. Her father was not a Craftsman, but all pledges were dangerous. <br>That night she leapt from her second-story room, calling upon a bit of Craft to cushion her fall. Shadows clustered around her as she made her way to the fresh grave. Her father&#x2019;s voice echoed in her ears as she unslung the shovel from her back. She ignored him. This dark work would help Edgemont, and her family. <br>Besides, it would be fun. <br>She did not use her Craft to open the grave. That was one of the few rules a Craftswoman always obeyed, even at the highest levels of study. The fresher the bodies, the better, and Craft sapped freshness from them. Instead Tara relied on the strength of her arms, and of her back. <br>She pulled a muscle after the first three feet of digging, and adjourned to a safe distance to rest before attacking the dirt again. The shovel wasn&#x2019;t made for this work, and her hands were months out of practice, their old digging calluses gone soft. She had stolen her father&#x2019;s work gloves, but they were comically large on her and their slipping against her skin caused blisters almost as bad as those she intended to prevent. <br>It took an hour&#x2019;s work to reach the corpses. <br>They were buried without coffins, so the soil would reclaim their bodies faster and leech the poison magic from them. Tara hadn&#x2019;t even needed to bring a crowbar. Pulling the corpses out of the hole was harder than she expected, though. Back at school, they had golems for this sort of work, or hirelings. <br>When she grabbed the first body by its wrists, the Raiders&#x2019; curse lashed out and spent itself against the wards glyphed into her skin. Harmless to her, the curse still stung, bad as when she chased her dog into stinging nettles as a girl. She swore. <br>Removing the corpses from the grave made more noise than Tara liked, but she couldn&#x2019;t work inside the pit. A grave&#x2019;s mouth circumscribed the night sky, and she wanted as much starfire as possible for the work at hand. It had been too long since she last stretched her wings. <br>In retrospect, the whole thing was a really, exceptionally, wonderfully bad idea. Had she expected the Edgemonters&#x2019; gratitude when their dead comrades stumbled to their posts the next evening, groaning from tongueless mouths? At the same time, though, it was such a <i>brilliant</i> idea&#x2014;simple, and so logical. Battle dead would not return much to the soil, but their corpses had enough strength left to fight for Edgemont. These revenant watchmen might not speak, and would be slower on the uptake than the living variety, but no wound could deter them, and the fiercest Craft would slide through their shambling corpses with no noticeable effect. <br>Nothing came from nothing, of course. The business of disinternment was strict. A dead body contained a certain amount of order. Locomotion required most of it, simple sensory perception much of the rest, and there wasn&#x2019;t a great deal left over for cognition. Laymen rarely understood. It wasn&#x2019;t like a Craftswoman <i>could</i> bring a person back to life unchanged and chose not to. <br>She drew the bent, sharp moonbeam that was her work knife from its place of concealment within the glyph over her heart, held it up to soak in starlight, and went to work on the twist of spirit and matter most folk still called <i>man</i> even after it had been dead for some time. <br>A revenant didn&#x2019;t require a will of its own, or at least not so robust a will as most humans thought they possessed. Slice! Or complex emotions, though those were more fundamental to the human animal and thus harder to pry free; she made her knife&#x2019;s edge jagged to saw them out, then fine and scalpel-sharp to excise the troublesome bits. Leave a fragment of self-preservation, and the seething rage left over from the last moments of the subject&#x2019;s life. There&#x2019;s almost always rage, Professor Denovo had explained patiently, time and again. Sometimes you have to dig for it, but it&#x2019;s there nonetheless. And buried beneath the detritus of thousands of years of civilization lay that most basic human power of identification: these are <i>my</i> people. Those others, well, those are food. <br>Textbook. <br>Tara gloried in the work. As her knife sang through dead flesh, she felt years of torment and the waking dream of Edgemont fade away. This was real, the acid-sharp scent of welded nerves, the soulstuff flowing through her hands, the corpses&#x2019; spasms as she worked her Craft upon them. Forgetting this, she had forgotten a piece of herself. She was complete again. <br>Which she couldn&#x2019;t exactly explain to the torch-bearing mob. <br>Her cry when the Raiders&#x2019; curse struck must have tipped them off, or else the darkness that spread across the village as she twisted starfire and moonlight through the warp and weft of her mind to bring a mockery of life to the dead. Maybe it had been the thunder of reanimation, as of a tombstone falling from a gruesome height. <br>Also, she had cackled as the corpses woke beneath her: a full-throated belly laugh, a laugh to make the earth shake. Good form required a guffaw at death&#x2019;s expense, though Professor Denovo always recommended his students practice discretion, perhaps for cases like this one. <br>&#x201c;Raiders!&#x201d; cried the front-most Edgemonter, a middle-aged wheat farmer with a round potbelly and the improbably heroic name of Roland DuChamp. Tara had settled his grandfather&#x2019;s will for him a month before. He was mad now with the fury of a man confronting something he cannot understand. &#x201c;Back for blood!&#x201d; <br>It didn&#x2019;t help that shadows still clung to Tara, shielding her from their sight. What the Edgemonters saw across the graveyard was monster more than woman, wreathed in starfire and night-made-flesh, save where her school glyphs glowed through in purest silver. <br>The townsfolk raised their weapons and advanced uneasily. <br>Tara put away her knife and extended her hands, trying to look friendly, or at least less threatening. She didn&#x2019;t banish the shadows, though. Her return had been awkward enough for Mother and Father without bringing a torch-wielding mob down upon them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here to hurt anyone.&#x201d; <br>The corpses, of course, chose that moment to sit up, growl with unearthly voices, and clumsily brandish weapons in their skeletal hands. <br>The mob screamed. The corpses groaned. And streaking through the darkness came the five remaining watchmen of Edgemont, the power of their office drawn about them. Halos of white light surrounded the watch, granting them spectral armor and the strength of ten men. Tara backed away farther, glancing about for an avenue of escape. <br>The eldest watchman, Thom Baker, raised his spear and called out, &#x201c;Stand, Raider!&#x201d; <br>Three of his comrades fell upon her revenants and wrestled them down. Tara had done her work well; recognizing their friends, the corpses put up little resistance. The odds stood at two to one against her, and, as her father knew, she was no warrior. <br>At this stage, dropping her cloak of darkness and trying to explain might not have done any good. They had caught her raising the dead. Perhaps she was not Tara Abernathy after all, but something wearing Tara&#x2019;s skin. They would cut off her head and move on to her family, make sure of the lot of them in one stroke. Justice would be swift, in the name of the Gods, fallen though most of them might...</p><h2>The Ideals Treasury of Prayer</h2><p>The Ideals Treasury of Prayer is a celebration of the joy and the strenth men and women through the ages have found in their time of prayer.

It's the story of a childhood and adolescence in the shadow of the Cold War, in a landscape at once startlingly beautiful and--unknown to those who lived there--tainted with invisible yet deadly particles of plutonium. <br><br>It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets--both family and government. Her father's hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what was made at Rocky Flats (cleaning supplies, her mother guessed)--best not to inquire too deeply into any of it. <br><br>But as Iversen grew older, she began to ask questions. She learned about the infamous 1969 Mother's Day fire, in which a few scraps of plutonium spontaneously ignited and--despite the desperate efforts of firefighters--came perilously close to a "criticality," the deadly blue flash that signals a nuclear chain reaction. Intense heat and radiation almost melted the roof, which nearly resulted in an explosion that would have had devastating consequences for the entire Denver metro area. Yet the only mention of the fire was on page 28 of the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, underneath a photo of the Pet of the Week. In her early thirties, Iversen even worked at Rocky Flats for a time, typing up memos in which accidents were always called "incidents."<br><br>And as this memoir unfolds, it reveals itself as a brilliant work of investigative journalism--a detailed and shocking account of the government's sustained attempt to conceal the effects of the toxic and radioactive waste released by Rocky Flats, and of local residents' vain attempts to seek justice in court. Here, too, are vivid portraits of former Rocky Flats workers--from the healthy, who regard their work at the plant with pride and patriotism, to the ill or dying, who battle for compensation for cancers they got on the job. <br><br>Based on extensive interviews, FBI and EPA documents, and class-action testimony, this taut, beautifully written book promises to have a very long half-life.</p></p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with the Author</strong> <br> <strong>Why did you write the book?</strong><br> Rocky Flats was the big secret of my childhood. No one knew what they did at the plant; the rumor in the neighborhood was that they made household cleaning products. We knew nothing about radioactive and toxic contamination. My childhood was also shadowed by the secrecy surrounding my father&#x2019;s alcoholism. My family was very close and loving but also troubled. I wrote the book to learn what really happened at Rocky Flats, to learn everything I could about plutonium pits and nuclear weapons and the crucial role the plant played during and after the Cold War. I also wanted to understand my family and the broader context of what it meant to grow up during the seventies. Secrecy at the level of the community and at the level of family turned out to be a central theme in the book. <p>One of the great ironies of my life is that I spent several years as a travel writer in Europe, looking for good stories to write about, and the biggest story turned out to be&#x2014;quite literally&#x2014;in my own backyard. My family and our neighbors were &#x201c;Cold War warriors,&#x201d; as the plutonium workers themselves were called, but no one told us.</p> <p><strong>How is Rocky Flats a global issue?</strong><br> The 2011 accident at Fukushima, following the tsunami, reminded the world in a terrible way that we cannot ignore the threat of radioactive contamination, whether it comes from nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons sites. The world has experienced many nuclear disasters in recent years, including accidents at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, the Mayak facility in Russia (the &#x201c;sister&#x201d; plant to Rocky Flats), Rocky Flats in Colorado, and other former nuclear weapons sites around the United States such as Hanford and Fernald. The health effects of short-term, high-level radioactive contamination are fairly well known. What are the health costs of long-term, low-level radioactive exposure? Scientists and physicists continue to debate the topic, but one fact is for sure: there is no safe level of exposure to plutonium. One millionth of a gram, particularly if it is inhaled, can cause cancer.</p> <p>Rocky Flats happened in my backyard, but in a sense it is happening in everyone&#x2019;s back yard. Many of us live in close proximity to former nuclear weapons sites or nuclear power plants with inadequate safety provisions. And, at a time when we are supposed to be decreasing our nuclear arsenal, the U.S. government is talking about producing nuclear triggers again. We need to pay attention.</p> <p><strong>Was it hard to write so intimately about your family?</strong><br> I believe that the most powerful way to tell a story is through personal, everyday experience. Every person on the planet has a story that is both ordinary and extraordinary. My siblings and I swam in the lake behind our house and rode our horses in the fields. We had, in many ways, a blessed childhood. And this kind of experience is one that many readers will share. What makes our story unique is that it connects, in ways that we never anticipated, to a broader historical and political narrative. The story of the 1969 fire at Rocky Flats&#x2014;which very nearly destroyed the entire metro Denver area&#x2014;is all the more powerful when you realize that my family was having a very pleasant Mother&#x2019;s Day brunch at a nearby restaurant. We had no idea what was going on&#x2014;and neither did other Coloradoans. It was only by including the experiences of me, my family, my neighbors, and my coworkers at Rocky Flats that I could truly bring the story to life. It was indeed a challenge to write intimately about things that, as a family, we were never supposed to discuss, including my father&#x2019;s drinking. And yet the end result was a tremendous sense of clarity and understanding.</p> <p><strong>What surprised you most during your research for the book?</strong><br> I was surprised, and continue to be surprised, by the secrecy surrounding this very dramatic story. What happened at Rocky Flats, during the Cold War and up to the present moment, is crucially important not only to Colorado but to the entire country. But so much of the story has been hidden over the years, and now it is in danger of being forgotten. Recently I stayed at a hotel just a few miles from the Rocky Flats site, and the young man at the front desk had grown up in Colorado. He&#x2019;d never heard of Rocky Flats. Of those people who do know the story--or part of it--many believe that Rocky Flats is old history, that it&#x2019;s irrelevant and insignificant. They believe the land is safe and the story is over. After all, you can&#x2019;t see or smell plutonium.</p> <p>Yet we cannot forget the story of Rocky Flats. The effects will linger far into the future. There were many other surprises too. During my research, I was shocked to discover how many tons of MUF, or &#x201c;Missing Unaccounted For&#x201d; plutonium, was missing, even to the present day. And the history of the 1989 FBI raid on Rocky Flats is fascinating. I believe it&#x2019;s the only time in the history of the United States that two government agencies--the FBI and the EPA--have raided another agency, the Department of Energy.</p> <p></p><p><b>KRISTEN IVERSEN</b> grew up in Arvada, Colorado, near the Rocky Flats nuclear weaponry facility and received a Ph.D. in English from the University of Denver.&nbsp;She is director of the MFA Program in Creative Writing at the University of Memphis and editor-in-chief of <i>The Pinch</i>, an award-winning literary journal.

From 1941 to 1945, government agencies, businesses, and private organizations issued an array of poster images linking the military front with the home front, calling upon all Americans to boost production at work and at home. The U.S. Office of War Information created the "Poster Pledge," urging volunteers to "avoid poster waste," "treat posters as real war ammunition," and "never let a poster lie idle." <br>This colorful collection of over 150 World War II-era posters focuses on the theme of wartime production on the home front. The range of designs and images will inspire graphic designers, while the descriptive captions and informative text will interest history and military buffs. Some of the famous slogans these posters introduced include "When you ride alone you ride with Hitler," "She won't talk-will you? The enemy has ears," "This is America... Keep it Free," and "Remember Pearl Harbor-purl harder!"</p><p>William L. Bird, Jr. and Harry R. Rubenstein are curators at the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., which houses this collection.In this fascinating account of new previously unreported information on the commission of American posters during World War II, the authors vividly present quotes revealing the goals and methods applied to pictorial standards. With new insights familiar posters come alive again as the strategies for their design are discussed and assesed in an up to date historical perspective. This book will be invaluable to all those interested in the World War II studies and graphic design. <strong>Therese Thau Heyman</strong><br><br> <b>Design for Victory</b> is a magnificant visual experience that captures America's ideological and cultural transformation during the nation's most popular 20th century war. Harry Rubenstein and William Bird have not only assembled a stunning set of images, but these two fine historians have also uncovered a set of class and gender transcripts that give unexpected tension to so many of these patriotic, productionist drawings and slogans.

L. Mencken's "Thirty-five Years of Newspaper Work." Written in 1941-42 and bequeathed to the library under time-lock upon Mencken's death in 1956, it is among the very last of his papers opened to the public. Thirty-five Years of Newspaper Work, a one-volume edition of highlights from the manuscript, vividly pictures the excitement of newspaper life in the heyday of print journalism.</p><p>Here Mencken colorfully recalls his years--mostly with the Baltimore Evening Sun--as a reporter and a writer of editorials that always caused a stir among the public and riots of indignation among his enemies. The volume includes important new material on his coverage of presidential candidates from 1912 to 1940 and the 1925 trial of the man he called the "infidel Scopes." </p><p>"The book reveals a man who loved food, alcohol, cigars, and good friends...

L. Mencken&#39;s &#34;Thirty-five Years of Newspaper Work&#34;. Written in 1941-42 and bequeathed to the library under time-lock upon Mencken&#39;s death in 1956, it is among the very last of his papers opened to the public. Thirty-five Years of Newspaper Work, a one-volume abridgement of Mencken&#39;s much longer memoir, vividly pictures the excitement of newspaper life in the heyday of print journalism. Here Mencken colorfully recalls his years - mostly with the Baltimore Evening Sun - as a reporter and a writer of editorials that always caused a stir among the public and uproars of indignation among his enemies. The volume includes important new material on his coverage of presidential candidates from 1912 to 1940 (Mencken on Harding&#39;s inaugural address: &#34;a string of wet sponges&#34;) and the 1925 trial of the man he called the &#34;infidel Scopes&#34;. Mencken also describes his brief stint as a war correspondent on Germany&#39;s subzero Eastern Front in 1917 and the perilous voyage back, which took him through Havana just as a revolution was breaking out. (He stayed to cover it.) He writes, with curious detachment, about the &#34;inevitable&#34; war and likely fate of Germany&#39;s Jews during a final visit to his ancestral homeland in summer 1938. And he describes colorful Baltimore personalities, shares local gossip, and offers candid - usually unflattering - portraits of the politicians and clerics he mostly despised.</p><h2>Ibsen Plays: 2: A Doll&#39;s House; An Enemy of the People; Hedda Gabler (World Classics)</h2><p><p><br>This volume contains Ibsen's two most famous and frequently read, studied and performed plays about women: A Doll's House (1879), his first international success, which 'exploded like a bomb into contemporary life', and Hedda Gabler (1890), now one of his most popular plays, but greeted at first with bewilderment and outrage ('The play is simply a bad escape of moral sewage-gas' Pictorial World).

Selected and edited by Edward MendelsonW. H. Auden was born in York in 1907, and brought up in Birmingham. He went to Christ Church College, Oxford, where Stephen Spender privately printed a booklet of his poems. After university he lived for a time in Berlin, before returning to England to teach. His first book, Poems, was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber in 1930. Other volumes of poems and plays followed during the 1930s. He went to Spain during the civil war, to Iceland (with Louis MacNeice) and later travelled to China. In 1939 he and Christopher Isherwood left for America, where Auden spent the next fifteen years lecturing, reviewing, writing poetry and opera librettos, and editing anthologies. He became an American citizen in 1946, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948. In 1956 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and a year later went to live in Kirchstetten in Austria, after spending several summers on Ischia.

With courage and relentless honesty, Dani Shapiro opens the door to her house, her marriage, and her heart, and invites us to witness her own marital reckoning--a reckoning in which she confronts both the life she dreamed of and the life she made, and struggles to reconcile the girl she was with the woman she has become. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the forces that shape our most elemental bonds? How do we make lifelong commitments in the face of identities that are continuously shifting, and commit ourselves for all time when the self is so often in flux? What happens to love in the face of the unexpected, in the face of disappointment and compromise--how do we wrest beauty from imperfection, find grace in the ordinary, desire what we have rather than what we lack? Drawing on literature, poetry, philosophy, and theology, Shapiro writes gloriously of the joys and challenges of matrimonial life, in a luminous narrative that unfurls with urgent immediacy and sharp intelligence. Artful, intensely emotional work from one of our finest writers.</p><p><b>DANI SHAPIRO&nbsp;</b>is the author of the memoirs <i>Still Writing</i>, <i>Devotion</i>, and <i>Slow Motion</i> and five novels including <i>Black &amp; White</i> and <i>Family History</i>.

A gust of wind lifts the hem of the bathrobe, exposing his pale legs as he stands on a sheet of snow-covered ice. His hair is more salt than pepper. His breath makes vaporous clouds in the cold. Walls of snow are packed against the sides of the driveway, white fields spread out to the woods in the distance. The sky is chalk. A rifle rests easily on his shoulder, pointed at the northernmost corner of our roof.</p><p>So. He bought the gun.&nbsp; I take a long sip of coffee. Our two dogs are sleeping on the rug next to my desk chair. The old, demented one is snoring. There&#x2019;s nothing I can do but watch as M. squeezes the trigger. <i>Bam! </i>I start, and the dogs leap up. The windows rattle. The whole house shakes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The woodpecker had arrived the previous fall. Once he chose our house he seemed quite content, settled in, as if he had every intention of staying a while. At first, I had no idea where the noise was coming from. <i>Rat-tat-tat. </i>From my study, it sounded like a loose shutter banging, though we had no shutters. It was almost a city sound &#x2013;&#x2013; like a faraway jackhammer &#x2013;&#x2013; out of place in the quiet of the country. <i>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat. </i>Of course, it seemed possible, too, that the infernal banging was entirely in my mind. &#x201c;My head,&#x201d; wrote Virginia Woolf, &#x201c;is a hive of words that won&#x2019;t settle.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t hold a thought. It was as if an internal axis had been jarred and tilted downward; words and images slipped through a chute into a dim, murky pool from which I could not retrieve them.</p><p>Finally, I spotted the woodpecker from my son&#x2019;s bathroom window. Perched on a drainpipe just below the wood shingled roof, he was a small, brown bird with a tiny head and a pointy beak that moved back and forth with astonishing speed as he hammered away at what was already a sizable hole in the side of the house. <i>Rat-tat-tat.</i></p><p>It had been a time of erosion. I&#x2019;d begun to see in metaphor. We&#x2019;d lived in the house for twelve years, and things were falling apart. The refrigerator stopped working one day. The banister warped and the spindles on the staircase loosened and clattered to the floor. An old, neglected apple tree on our property split in two, its trunk as hollow as a drum. The house needed painting. The well needed fracking, whatever that meant. The front door was cracked, and on winter days, a sliver of wind could be felt inside.</p><p>Late that same fall of the woodpecker, as I sat reading at the kitchen table one afternoon, two large, mangy creatures loped across the meadow. One was grey, the other a pale, milky brown, they were otherworldly, terrifying. My spine tingled. I grabbed my phone to take their picture, then texted it to M., who was in the city that day.</p><p><i>Wolves?</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;No.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;Sure?</i></p><p><i>Yes. </i></p><p><i>Coyotes.</i></p><p><i>Not coyotes. I know coyotes.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The basement regularly flooded. If the wind blew in a certain way during a heavy rainfall, we could count on a half inch of water in the workroom where M. kept projects in varying states of half-completion. On a long table, he had hundreds of photos cut into stamp-sized pieces. These, he planned to assemble into a photo collage. A finished one from years earlier hangs in our guest bathroom. I never tire of looking it: our now-teenaged son as a toddler, hoisted on the shoulders of a friend, a smiling, radiant man whose daughter will later fall to her death from a Brooklyn rooftop; my mother in a hat to cover her bald head, months before she died; my mother- in-law before Alzheimer&#x2019;s set in; the three of us &#x2013;&#x2013; my little family and I &#x2013;&#x2013;on the steps of our Brooklyn townhouse; then older, on the porch of our house in Connecticut. <i>Alive. Dead. Lost. </i>Like the names I refuse to cross out in my address book, I catalog those I have loved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Honey!&#x201d; I called downstairs, keeping an eye on the woodpecker who, if he noticed me, didn&#x2019;t seem to care. &#x201c;I need you!&#x201d;</p><p>M. peered at the woodpecker through the bathroom window. &#x201c;Little fucker.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have to replace all that siding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put it on the list.&#x201d;</p><p>The list included pressing items such as painting the house, fixing the front door. We really did need to install a generator, replace the heating system. The list had once included items like redoing the bathrooms, building an addition. I&#x2019;d stopped keeping a list.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting a gun.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a gun in the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a real gun. A pellet gun.&nbsp; Nail the fucker.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I did some research. All the while, the pecking continued. More holes were hammered into the side of our house. A friend recommended a brick of suet, hung from a tree. Another suggested a porcelain owl placed atop our roof.&nbsp; M. is not fond of home remedies. The weather grew colder. Leaves on the trees turned russet, deep yellow, bright burgundy.&nbsp; Families of wild turkeys strutted across the front meadow. My mind was on fire. Each day, I sat in my second floor office and heard <i>rat-tat-tat-tat-tat.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ll take care of it</i>, M. said. A familiar refrain, one I have always loved and long to believe. This longing &#x2013; my longing &#x2013; is part of our marriage. We have been together for nearly two decades. The woodpecker, the mangy creatures, the hive of words. The creaky house, the velocity of time, the accretion of sorrow. The things that can and cannot be fixed. <i>I&#x2019;ll take care of it</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>M., before I knew him, owned <i>real </i>guns.&nbsp; He had been a foreign correspondent working out of Africa, in territory that required bodyguards and weapons. He kept a Kalashnikov stored in a locker in Mogadishu. On occasion, he wore a bulletproof vest. It hangs on a hook in our coat closet.</p><p>Now, he is having a tete-a-tete with a woodpecker as I stand holding one quivering dog while petting the other. He hadn&#x2019;t listened to me. When had he snuck a gun into the house? Where had he bought it? Walmart? <i>Bam! </i>The sound echoes off the roof.&nbsp; His hair is standing on end and he looks not unlike Einstein. A small dark speck against the white sky as the bird flies away, and I can almost hear its laughter, a cartoon bubble: <i>you can&#x2019;t catch me!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have recently embarked on a massive housecleaning after reading a popular book about the Japanese art of tidying up.&nbsp; It falls into the department of things we can control. The author instructs readers to empty the contents of every single household drawer and closet and lay it all out: the old sneakers, balled up work-out clothes, tangled necklaces, single earrings, gift soap still in cellophane wrappers. The report cards, paper machï¿½ art projects, baby bjorn. The boxes of heating pads from a long-ago bout with sciatica. The pregnancy test displaying the pink line. The electric &#x2018;smores maker, a housewarming gift, deposited unopened in the back of the coat closet.</p><p><i>I found these old journals of yours. </i>Just yesterday, M. handed me two thin, spiral-bound notebooks. One is red, the other blue. They don&#x2019;t look familiar. I open the red one. Dated June 8, 1997, the entry reads: <i>Day one. Arrived early in London and bought books at Heathrow (paperback ed.of Angela&#x2019;s Ashes</i>.<i>) Arrived in Paris in the early afternoon (Orly) and took a</i>&nbsp;<i>taxi to the Relais St. Germain. D. unpacked. Loved the room, great big bed, fluffy towels. </i>My handwriting looks to me like a letter to my future self, a missive launched forward through time. If you had asked me if I&#x2019;d kept a journal on our honeymoon, I would have told you with certainty that I had not. And who the hell writes about herself in the third person in her diary?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Today we ventured across the Seine only to discover that the Beauborg was closed. Went to Agnes B. where M. bought two nice shirts. Walked through the Marais, went to Ma Bourgoune, where a pigeon shat all over the back of M.&#x2019;s new Agnes B. shirt. D. went upstairs and washed it off in a public restroom.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We weren&#x2019;t all that young when we married. I was thirty-five, M. forty-one. As I read my entries, I feel time collapsing on itself. It is as if I can reach out and tap that blissed-out honeymooning not-so-terribly young woman on the shoulder, point her away from the fluffy towels and cafï¿½ and shitting pigeons and direct her toward another screen, a future screen. As</p><p>she walks into a shop on the Place Vendome <i>(D. finally ended her search for</i> <i>the perfect watch to go with her beautiful new wedding band) </i>I want to suggest to her that life is long. That this is the beginning. And that it may be true, at least in poetic terms, that beginnings are like seeds that contain within them everything that will ever happen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the highest shelf in my office closet, five boxes filled with reams of pages are stacked along with several cloth-covered volumes from the years I kept journals. Keeping journals was a practice for me, a way of ordering my life. It was an attempt to separate the interior from the exterior. To keep all my trash &#x2013;&#x2013; this is the way I thought of it &#x2013;&#x2013; in one place. Into the journals I poured every thought, each uncomfortable desire. Every petty resentment, seething insecurity, unexpressed envy that would be boring to all the world except &#x2013;&#x2013; perhaps &#x2013;&#x2013; to me. I continued the journal practice for years after becoming a writer, because I thought of the journals as the place where the detritus would be discarded, leaving only the essential &#x2013;&#x2013;somehow the process itself would determine which was which &#x2013;&#x2013; for my <i>real </i>work.&nbsp; I never imagined that a soul would read the journals. I would have been horrified, mortified if anyone had seen them. So why are they still on a shelf in my closet? Why have I kept them?</p><p>The red and blue notebooks are, I believe, the last journals in which I wrote. After we returned from our honeymoon, that practice, which had accompanied me all through my teens and twenties and into my thirties, disappeared. It was disappearing even as I wrote in them, <i>I </i>becoming <i>she</i>. Interspersed in those thin notebooks were other things: lists, thoughts, ideas. But that still doesn&#x2019;t explain why I haven&#x2019;t burned them. They aren&#x2019;t there for posterity. Nor for reference. I don&#x2019;t believe the young woman who wrote them has anything to teach me. What does she know? She hasn&#x2019;t lived my life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>After breakfast we drove to Massaune, home of the best olive oil in France. Picked up three bottles.

But you write what comes back to you, and then afterward it comes back to you all over again. <br><br>I once wrote a novel called <i>The Divided Man</i> about the Blue Rose murders, and in that book I called Damrosch Hal Esterhaz. I never alluded to my own connections to the Blue Rose murders, but those connections were why I wrote the book. (There was one other reason, too.) I wanted to explain things to myself&#x2014;to see if I could slice through to the truth with that old, old weapon, the battered old sword, of story telling. <br><br>I wrote <i>The Divided Man</i> after I was processed out of the army and had settled into a little room near Bang Luk, the central flower market in Bangkok. In Vietnam I had killed several people at long distance and one close up, so close that his face was right before me. In Bangkok, that face kept coming back to me while I was writing. And with it came, attached like an enormous barnacle to a tiny boat, the other Vietnam, the Vietnam before Vietnam, of childhood. When my childhood began coming back to me, I went off the rails for a bit. I became what you could charitably call "colorful." After a year or so of disgrace, I remembered that I was thirty-odd years old, no longer a child, that I had a calling of a kind, and I began to heal. Either childhood is a lot more painful the second time around, or it's just less bearable. None of us are as strong or as brave as the children we used to be. <br><br>About a year after I straightened out, I came back to America and wound up writing a couple of books with a novelist named Peter Straub. These were called <i>Koko</i> and <i>Mystery</i>, and maybe you read them. It's okay if you didn't. Peter's a nice enough kind of guy, and he lives in a big gray Victorian house in Connecticut, just off Long Island Sound. He has a wife and two kids, and he doesn't get out much. Peter's office on the third floor of his house was the size of my whole loft on Grand Street, and his air conditioning and his sound system always worked. <br><br>Peter liked listening to my descriptions of Millhaven. He was fascinated with the place. He understood exactly how I felt about it. "In Millhaven, snow falls in the middle of summer," I'd say, "sometimes in Millhaven, flights of angels blot out the whole sky," and he'd beam at me for about a minute and a half. Here are some other things I told him about Millhaven: once, on the near south side of town, a band of children killed a stranger, dismembered him, and buried the pieces of his body beneath a juniper tree, and later the divided and buried parts of the body began to call out to each other; once a rich old man raped his daughter and kept her imprisoned in a room where she raved and drank, raved and drank, without ever remembering what had happened to her; once the pieces of the murdered man buried beneath the juniper tree called out and caused the children to bring them together; once a dead man was wrongly accused of terrible crimes. And once, when the parts of the dismembered man were brought together at the foot of the tree, the whole man rose and spoke, alive again, restored. <br><br>For we were writing about a mistake committed by the Millhaven police and endorsed by everyone else in town. The more I learned, the worse it got: along with everyone else, I had assumed that William Damrosch had finally killed himself to stop himself from murdering people, or had committed suicide out of guilt and terror over the murders he had already done. Damrosch had left a note with the words BLUE ROSE on the desk in front of him. <br><br>But this was an error of interpretation&#x2014;of imagination. What most of us call intelligence is really imagination&#x2014;sympathetic imagination. The Millhaven police were wrong, and I was wrong. For obvious reasons, the police wanted to put the case to rest; I wanted to put it to rest for reasons of my own.<br>I've been living in New York for six years now. Every couple of months I take the New Haven Line from Grand Central, get off at the Greens Farms stop, and stay up late at night drinking and talking with Peter. He drinks twenty-five-year-old malt whiskey, because he's that kind of guy, and I drink club soda. His wife and his kids are asleep and the house is quiet. I can see stars through his office skylight, and I'm aware of the black bowl of night over our heads, the huge darkness that covers half the planet. Now and then a car swishes down the street, going to Burying Hill Beach and Southport. <br><br><i>Koko</i> described certain things that happened to members of my old platoon in and after the war, and <i>Mystery</i> was about the long-delayed aftermath of an old murder in a Wisconsin resort. Because we liked the idea, we set the novel on a Caribbean island, but the main character, Tom Pasmore&#x2014;who will turn up later in these pages&#x2014;was someone I knew back in Millhaven. He was intimately connected with the Blue Rose murders blamed on William Damrosch, and a big part of <i>Mystery</i> is his discovery of this connection. <br><br>After <i>Mystery</i> I thought I was done with Damrosch, with Millhaven, and with the Blue Rose murders. Then I got a call from John Ransom, another old Millhaven acquaintance, and because much in his life had changed, my life changed too. John Ransom still lived in Millhaven. His wife had been attacked and beaten into a coma, and her attacker had scrawled the words BLUE ROSE on the wall above her body.</p><h2>The House of a Thousand Lanterns</h2><p>Her fascination with Chinese art and her marriage to an older man lead Jane Lindsay to Hong Kong and the treasure-laden House of a Thousand Lanterns</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettesJane Lindsay never dreamed she would be wealthy.

Better known in Europe than in his native America for most of this career, he achieved international success and celebrity during the 1960s when his banned "Paris" books--beginning with <i>Tropic of Cancer</i>--were published here and judged by the Supreme Court not to be obscene. Until then he had toiled in relative obscurity and poverty. <i>The Unknown Henry Miller</i> recounts Miller's career from its beginnings in Paris in the 1930s but focuses on his years living in Big Sur, California, from 1944 to 1961, during which he wrote many of his most important books, including <i>The Rosy Crucifixion</i> trilogy, married and divorced twice, raised two children, painted watercolors, and tried to live out an aesthetic and personal credo of self-realization.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written with the cooperation of the Henry Miller, Anais Nin, and other estates, <i>The Unknown Henry Miller</i> quotes extensively from Miller's correspondence in order to offer the reader direct experience of the author and man. It also draws on material not available to previous biographers, including interviews with Lepska Warren, Miller's third wife, and revelations from unpublished portions of Anais Nin's diaries. Behind the "bad boy" image, the author finds a man with devoted friendships, whose challenge of literary sexual taboos was part of a broader assault on the dehumanization of man and commercialization during the postwar years. He puts Miller's alleged misogyny in the context of his satire of sexual mores in general, and makes the case for restoring this groundbreaking writer to his rightful place in the American literary canon.</p><p>I began reading Miller in the 1990s and was immediately drawn to him--his personable voice, his message of self-liberation through self-acceptance. I also found the sex scenes in his notorious banned books quite funny. Reading about him, I came to feel that he was not properly appreciated or understood by his American audience, and I decided to produce a portrait of him derived primarily from what he wrote himself and what others who knew him intimately wrote about him. Writing the book was for me a labor of love, a way to express my gratitude and admiration for the gift of his many books."The best book ever written about my father." --<b>Tony Miller</b><br><br>"The Unknown Henry Miller is a fascinating book, filled with insight and revelations. If you are passionate about Miller's work, this book will deepen your understanding. And if you aren't very familiar with Miller's life and writings, Hoyle will make you want to rush to read him now." --<b>Will Schwalbe, author of the New York Times bestseller <i>The End of Your Life Book Club</i></b><br><br>"The Unknown Henry Miller is a must read for those who thought they knew--and those who know nothing--about the shocking Tropic of Cancer genius who pushed the censorial envelope to make readers think about what is obscenity and why. Arthur Hoyle has expertly penetrated the Miller myth to analyze his prodigious body of work and the underpinnings of Miller's attitudes toward women, beginning with his ruinous mother." --<b>Myra MacPherson author of the award winning <i>All Governments Lie</i> and the forthcoming <i>The Scarlet Sisters: Sex Suffrage and Scandal in the Gilded Age</i>. </b><br><br>"An excellent introduction to Henry Miller, the great liberator. He knew that one has to go through the body to find the soul." --<b>Erica Jong, Bestselling Author of<i> Fear Of Flying</i></b><br><br>"Arthur Hoyle has delivered on his promise to reveal the 'unknown' Henry Miller. On every page there is unexpected data, nuggets of facts unearthed by his deep and extensive research (especially about Miller's time here in Big Sur), wonderful new insights, or familiar insights freshly-turned. Above all, this is a smart biography. Written with a passionate drive, 'The Unknown Henry Miller' is a page-turner, and I look forward to the discussions and commentary that are sure to follow." --<b>Magnus Torï¿½n, Executive Director, Henry Miller Memorial Library Inc.</b></p><h2>Hawkeye vs. Deadpool</h2><p>Once upon a time, champions emerged to fight the evil plaguing humanity.

Among his numerous publications on the New Testament are his commentaries on the Gospel of Luke, Acts, 1-2 Thessalonians, the Pastoral Epistles and 1 Peter and 1-3 John. He is coauthor of <em>Exploring the New Testament: A Guide to the Letters and Revelation</em> and coeditor of the New International Greek Testament Commentary series, as well as the author of the series' volume on Luke.

He received a PhD from the University of Aberdeen and a DD from Asbury Theological Seminary."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible."

Jack's hand had snaked from beneath the covers, fumbling for the phone. He grunted a sleepy hello, listened for a moment, then sat up suddenly alert.<br><br>"Is it the girls?" Sarah asked as she turned on the bedside lamp. They had dropped the girls off at the University of Montana just a few weeks earlier and Sarah's worst fear was receiving an early-morning call like this. Jack shook his head and Sarah breathed a sigh of relief.<br><br>"It's Julia," Jack said after hanging up, his voice thick with emotion. "She had a fall. I need to go home."<br><br>Now, as their airplane ascended into the blue Montana sky, Sarah settled into her seat and gazed down at the expansive landscape below. The mountains, tipped with white, seemed to burst from the trees, while rivers meandered across the earth and deep lakes glittered in the midmorning September sun. Though she had grown up in Larkspur, she never tired of its beauty and she hated leaving, even for just a short time. She and Jack hadn't strayed from Montana in years, saw no need to travel to exotic lands, to ocean coasts or dry deserts. All they needed they found in their home on Larkspur Lake.<br><br>She looked over at Jack, who was shifting in his seat, trying to find a comfortable position for his long legs. The crosshatched lines that rested at the corners of his eyes had become more pronounced overnight, and two deep grooves above the bridge of his nose extended to his forehead like a ladder of worry. She had seen this same look on his face when the first of their twin daughters, Elizabeth, was born and had waited a full sixty seconds, an eternity, to take her first breath. Saw the same expression when their other daughter, Emma, took a nasty tumble from her bike and came to them crying, her elbow dangling helplessly at her side. She knew that look. Jack was scared.<br><br>She wished there was something that she could say to ease his nerves, but Jack was a reserved man who kept his worries to himself. She reached for his hand and absentmindedly he fiddled with her wedding band, spinning it around and around her finger like a talisman. "When do you think we'll get to Penny Gate?" Sarah asked.<br><br>Jack checked his watch and mentally calculated the distance to the small Iowa town where he grew up. "I'd say we'll get there about seven if we go straight to the hospital. Uncle Hal said they stabilized Julia in the emergency room and now she's in the ICU."<br><br>"From what you've told me about your aunt, if anyone can pull through such a bad fall, it's Julia. Thank God your sister found her so quickly."<br><br>"Yeah, if Amy showed up at the house any later, I don't know if she would still be alive." Jack went silent then, as if lost in thought, focusing intently on the seat in front of him.<br><br>Sarah could hear the worry in his voice. What would they find when they arrived in Penny Gate? Would his aunt be awake and grateful to see him or would she succumb to her injuries and not survive the night? "We'll be there soon," Sarah assured him.<br><br>"You know, it's been twenty years since I've been home. After the accident, I just couldn't go back there. Hal and Julia took us in and treated us as their own, and I couldn't even be bothered to visit in all these years."<br><br>Jack rarely spoke of his life in Penny Gate, of the years before the accident that took the lives of both his parents. He kept those memories well hidden, the only part of himself that was off-limits to Sarah. All she really knew was that on a rainy spring night the year Jack turned fifteen, his mother and father climbed into their rusty old pickup truck and Jack never saw either of them again.<br><br>Jack had been her physical therapist, treating Sarah's injured shoulder after her own car accident, and after twelve painful but productive rehab sessions he announced that he had done all he could for her, at least physical-therapy-wise, then promptly asked her out on a date.<br><br>She remembered the night Jack told her about the accident as if it was burned in her memory. They had been dating for about a month and spent the weekend kayaking on Deer Lake, three hours north of Minneapolis. It was a warm summer night; the sun was beginning to set, a large gilded orb melting into the lake's horizon. They were in no rush to return to shore and laid their paddles across their laps and drifted languidly across the water.<br><br>Sarah, at the front of the kayak, gently waved away mosquitoes that hummed past her ear and asked Jack about the night his parents had died. She wasn't sure why he chose that moment to answer; he had sidestepped her questions so many times before. Perhaps it was because in the rear of the kayak she couldn't see his face. Perhaps it was the remote location; they hadn't seen another boat in hours. The only sound was the gentle slap of water against the side of the kayak. Jack had breathed the details of the story in staccato, short-clipped phrases that seemed to punch the air from his chest: <em>He was drinking again. I should have stopped her. Stopped him. The roads were wet.</em><br><br>Sarah wanted to turn and reach for Jack but forced herself to remain facing forward in the kayak, afraid that any movement would cause him to stop talking.<br><br><em>He flipped the truck. Upside down in a cornfield. Killed instantly.</em><br><br>Jack's breath came out in jagged chuffs and Sarah could tell that he was crying. Slowly, carefully, as one might to a skittish animal, she reached behind her and found Jack's hand.<br><br>A year later they were married, she quit her job as a reporter and they moved to Larkspur to begin a family. In the past twenty years Sarah had wanted to ask Jack so many questions. Not just about the accident and the years that followed, but about what his life was like before his parents died. Simple questions. Did he look more like his mother or his father? What books did she read to him before bedtime or did she call him by a pet name? Did his father teach him to bait a hook or skip rocks across a pond? But every time she broached the subject, Jack would find a way to avoid the conversation. He wouldn't let her in.<br><br>Jack released Sarah's hand and ran his fingers through his gray-flecked hair, a nervous gesture that she knew he would repeat a hundred times before they landed. "I shouldn't have waited so long to come back," he murmured.<br><br>Jack jiggled his leg up and down, striking the back of the seat with his knee. The man in front of him turned around and glowered with irritation. Jack didn't notice.<br><br>"I'm sure they understand," Sarah said, laying a hand on his leg to still it. But she wondered if Jack's aunt and uncle truly understood how the boy they took into their home could stay away for nearly two decades.<br><br>"I should have called her back." Jack's voice caught and he cleared his throat. "It just slipped my mind and I knew she'd call again in a few days." Jack's aunt, without fail, called the house each Sunday evening to check in and catch up on the events of their week. But the previous Sunday they were out for a walk and had missed Julia's call. She had left a message on their machine, but it was late when they returned home and Jack had forgotten to call back the following day.<br><br>When they came home and listened to the message, Sarah had thought she detected a shakiness in Julia's voice, a tremor that made her think of Parkinson's. At the time she had dismissed it, but now she wondered if she should have said something to Jack.<br><br>"Do you think that Julia sounded different the last few times she called?" Sarah asked, pulling her cardigan more tightly around herself to stave off the plane's chilly temperature.<br><br>Jack narrowed his eyes as if mentally shuffling through recent conversations with his aunt. "I don't think so. What do you mean?"<br><br>Sarah hesitated. "I'm not sure. Has Hal said anything about any health concerns?"<br><br>"No, but that doesn't mean she hasn't had any problems," Jack admitted. He tilted his head back against the headrest and stared up at the plane's ceiling. "I can't believe they still live in that house," he said, changing the subject. "It's too big for two people. And those steps. They're so steep. I tripped down them all the time when I was a kid. I just can't believe that someone hasn't had a bad fall before now. The place is a death trap."<br><br>Jack crossed his arms in front of his chest and burrowed more deeply into his seat. "We used to go to this pond," he said as she slid her hand through his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. The comforting scent of his shaving cream and the starch used to iron his shirt filled her nose. "Aunt Julia would pack these elaborate picnics. Strawberries that we'd spent hours picking and pickled herring on crackers, cheese with names we couldn't pronounce and her homemade bread." Jack's voice sounded far away and Sarah hung on his words. "Then we'd all climb into the back of Uncle Hal's truck and drive down the old mud road to the pond. We'd sit on the bank and fish for hours and would end up with just a few bluegills, a bass if we were lucky. Julia would make a big deal out of each one we caught, though, clapping her hands and jumping up and down."<br><br>Sarah thought about the times they had taken Elizabeth and Emma fishing. The girls squealing over the wiggling worms that Jack used to bait their hooks. Their delight at Jack pretending to buckle beneath the weight of their catches.<br><br>"Sometimes I can still taste those strawberries." Jack smiled sadly and Sarah squeezed his hand.<br><br>"It must be hard going back," Sarah reflected. "Lots of memories."<br><br>He nodded tentatively, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. "Everything seemed so simple then. Easier somehow." Jack turned to the window then and looked out at the far-reaching landscape below. The world was endless from this vantage point, full of infinite wonder and possibility, and Jack drifted off in thought as he took in the view.<br><br>"I remember on stormy summer nights," he started, his voice tinged with sadness. "When the power would go out, my mom would scavenge through the cupboards and drawers looking for flashlights." Sarah's breath caught in her chest. Jack never spoke about his parents. Ever.<br><br>"Amy and I would grab the clean sheets from the clothesline just before the rain began to fall. Then we'd throw them over the furniture to make forts. We'd pretend the flashlights were our campfire and tell each other stories..."<br><br>Jack looked as if he was going to say more but instead he rubbed his hand across his mouth as if wiping away the thought. He turned back from the window and leaned his head against the headrest and closed his eyes.<br><br>Sarah wanted to press for more, but she knew this fleeting moment of reminiscence was over.<br><br>As the airplane carried them away from the life they had made together, she watched Jack doze. Behind his closed eyelids she knew that a thousand secret memories drifted. She wanted him to let her in, to know that he was safe. Safe with her. Maybe she couldn't erase all the sadness and bitterness he was carrying. But she could be there for him and help him through the pain.<br><br>Despite the sad circumstances of their trip to Penny Gate, Sarah was looking forward to seeing the town Jack grew up in. She wanted to drive along the roads that he once traveled, to see the bedroom that he once slept in, to spend time with his family, whom she had only gotten to know over the years through phone calls and birthday cards. She thought it might bring her closer to him.<br><br>She let Jack rest until the pilot's voice filled the airplane cabin, announcing their impending arrival in Chicago. The fasten-seat-belt light blinked on, and she lightly nudged Jack awake. Down below, the blue expanse of Lake Michigan was edged by miles of skyscrapers. Each drop in altitude was jarring, and Sarah's stomach churned. She reached for Jack's hand and closed her eyes, squeezing his fingers tightly until finally the wheels touched the runway.<br><br>They had only fifteen minutes to get to their gate in time to catch their connecting flight to the small airport near Penny Gate, and Sarah scurried to keep up with Jack's long strides as they wove their way through crowds of travelers, her carry-on bag bumping along behind her.<br><br>When they arrived at their gate, they joined the line of passengers to board their connecting flight. Jack quickly called Hal for an update on Julia's condition.<br><br>"She hasn't woken up yet," he reported grimly when he hung up the phone. "She's back from X-ray and she has a skull fracture, a broken pelvis and both arms are fractured."<br><br>Sarah handed her boarding pass to the gate agent. "That's terrible. Does she need surgery?"<br><br>"I don't know. Not yet, anyway. They're watching her closely to make sure there isn't any bleeding on her brain."<br><br>They were the last of the fifty passengers to board the full flight. Because of their late booking Sarah's seat was three rows behind Jack and across the aisle.<br><br>It was just a short thirty-minute flight to the small regional airport near Penny Gate, and as they got closer to their destination, Sarah watched from afar as Jack seemed to grow more and more restless. His foot tapped nervously and he kept checking his watch. Sarah knew that a million thoughts were banging around Jack's head. He hadn't seen his aunt and uncle in twenty years. How would they receive him? With open arms or cold reservation? Jack was returning to the town where he was born and raised but whose roads had taken his parents away from him. Anxiety seemed to radiate from his body and Sarah wanted to go to him, to reassure him that everything was going to be okay, and if it wasn't she would be right there beside him.<br><br>Sarah peered out the window as they descended. Jack was right. He had told her that Iowa had a beauty all its own, and the landscape was a patchwork of verdant greens, golden yellows and rich browns.<br><br>When they landed, Jack waited for Sarah at the end of the jet bridge. "Are you okay?" Sarah asked with concern. His skin had taken on a sickly hue.<br><br>"Just a little airsick," Jack explained as they went in search of a rental car.<br><br></p><h2>Mrs. Chippy&#39;s Last Expedition: The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton&#39;s Polar-Bound Cat</h2><p>A diary of an astute male cat, &#34;Mrs. Chippy,&#34; documents his journey to Antarctica with human associate Harry &#34;Chippy&#34; McNeish, and the survival techniques he adapted after the ship was damaged, as well as details of his other duties, including watching for changes in weather and tormenting the sled dogs.</p><p>Caroline Alexander is the author of three books<i>One Dry Season: In the Footsteps of Mary Kingsley; The Way to Xanadu;</i> and <i>Battle's End: A Seminal Football Team Revisited</i>all published by Knopf. She lives in New Hampshire.Here's a story to rank among favorite animal stories for grown-ups of all time. With a lovely, witty, British touch, Caroline Alexander composes a cat's-eye journal of Ernest Shackleton's 1914 Antarctic expedition. Mrs. Chippy keeps an excellent log of shipboard duties, events, and feline observations. Steven Crossley is quite brilliant, making Mrs. Chippy as endearing to listeners as he, Chippy, was to the Endurance crew. Chippy's Scottish burr--for he is mate of Scots ship's carpenter Chipps--is distinct as he reviews daily routines, such as the seal watch or a casual stroll across the top of the sled dog kennels. Crossley also portrays the other crew members with warmth and distinction.

In this book, Donald E. Worcester synthesizes the total historical experience of the Apaches, from the post-Conquest Spanish era to the late twentieth century. In clear, fluent prose he focuses primarily on the nineteenth century, the era of the Apaches' sometimes splintered but always determined resistance to the white intruders. They were never a numerous tribe, but, in their daring and skill as commando-like raiders, they well deserved the name "Eagles of the Southwest."</p><p>The book highlights the many defensive stands and the brilliant assaults the Apaches made on their enemies. The only effective strategy against them was to divide and conquer, and the Spaniards (and after them the Anglo-Americans) employed it extensively, using renegade Indians as scouts, feeding traveling bands, and trading with them at their presidios and missions. When the Mexican Revolution disrupted this pattern in 1810, the Apaches again turned to raiding, and the Apache wars that erupted with the arrival of the Anglo-Americans constitute some of the most sensational chapters in America's military annals.</p><p>The author describes the Apaches' life today on the Arizona and New Mexico reservations, where they manage to preserve some of the traditional ceremonies, while trying to provide livelihoods for all their people. The Apaches still have a proud history in their struggles against overwhelming odds of numbers and weaponry. Worcester here re-creates that history in all its color and drama.</p></p><p><b>Donald E. Worcester</b>, (1915-2003) was a native of Tempe, Arizona and Professor of History in Texas Christian University. He received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California at Berkeley, where he was a student of Herbert E. Bolton. He wrote extensively on the Spaniards of the New World, as well as Latin American and North American civilization.</p><h2>The Metamorphoses</h2><p>One of the founding texts of Western literature, the Metamorphoses is nevertheless anything but earnest or off-putting. Ovids sequence of fifteen witty and playful poems sketches the history of the world from its creation to the poets own time through a series of transformation myths in which gods and goddesses succumb to all-too-human passions, not least in the matter of love. Frequently translated, imitated and paraphrased.</p><p>Publius Ovidius Naso, known to the English world as Ovid, was born in 43 BC in the Abruzzo, Italy, studied oratory in Rome and travelled to Greece. Intended for public career, he instead devoted himself to poetry. Amongst his other works are the Amores (loves), Heroides (heroines) and the Arts Amatoria (art of love). For reasons which remain unclear, he was banished to the Black Sea by the Emperor Augustus in AD 8. Grief-stricken, he composed there his Tristia (elegies). He was never allowed to return to Rome, and died in exile in AD 17. TRANSLATOR BIOGRAPHY: Allen Mandelbaum was born in 1926 and died in 2011.

Yet the problem with a lot of Southern cooking is the ever-present can of cream of mushroom soup. In this lively, humorous cookbook, Robert St. John shows Southerners (and all fans of the cuisine) how to indulge in the ideas and tastes that inspired Southern cooking, without resorting to ingredients like that canned soup in the recipe. The classic dishes are all here; they just taste better! Sections include cocktail party fare, funeral food, breakfasts, salads and soups, summer suppers, cakes, vegetables, chitlins, desserts, sides, and much more. Recipes include Buttermilk Chicken, Pecan Crusted Redfish, Fried Catfish, Cajun Popcorn, Corn Fritters, and lots of other Southern classics.</p></p><p><strong>Robert St. John</strong> has been Executive Chef/Owner of the Purple Parrot Cafï¿½ and Mahogany Bar in Hattiesburg and Meridian, Mississippi. He writes a syndicated food column for several newspapers, and hosts a monthly television cooking show. He lives in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.Southern author and restaurateur St. John (My South: A People, A Place, A World All Its Own) offers up his relatively faithful take on southern cuisine in this collection of traditional recipes. His approach is to take a traditional dish such as macaroni and cheese or deviled eggs and prepare it as a chef would, so deviled eggs benefit from a pinch of white pepper and white balsamic vinegar, while macaroni and cheese is jazzed up with white pepper, onions and a can of sweetened condensed milk. (St. John even offers up a bï¿½chamel version of cream of mushroom soup.) There are still plenty of recipes for purists: fried chicken, greens and chicken pot pie are all prepared with just a handful of ingredients, and there isn't a truffle or slice of foie gras to be found. Even the most complicated recipes are well within the range of the average cook, since the book's emphasis is on taste rather than technique or exotic ingredients. In addition to the recipes, the book is peppered with handy tips such as how to handle raw chicken to avoid contamination (use a metal colander) and preserve overripe bananas (freeze, then thaw when ready to use). St. John also includes meditations on such uniquely southern topics as sweet tea and chitlins. While there is little new culinary ground covered here, those looking for an overview of southern cooking could do worse. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tolkien, with a redesigned cover to match the distinctive paperback editions of The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. In the 25 years since Tolkien&#39;s death in September 1973, millions have read The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and become fascinated about the very private man behind the books. Born in Bloemfontein in January 1892, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was orphaned in childhood, brought up in near-poverty and almost thwarted in adolescent romance. He served in the First World War, surviving the Battle of the Somme, where he lost some of his closest friends, and returned to academic life, achieving high repute as a scholar and university teacher, eventually becoming Merton Professor of English at Oxford. Then suddenly his life changed dramatically. One day while marking essay papers he found himself writing &#39;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit&#39; -- and worldwide renown awaited him. Humphrey Carpenter was given unrestricted access to all Tolkien&#39;s papers, and interviewed his friends and family. From these sources he follows the long and painful process of creation that produced The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion and offers a wealth of information about the life and work of the twentieth century&#39;s most cherished author.</p><p>There may be a corner of the world where the name J.R.R. Tolkien is unknown, but you would be hard-pressed to find it. Since their publication, <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> have been published in every major language of the world. And though he single-handedly gave a mythology to the English and was beloved by millions, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien remained refreshingly unchanged by his fame and fortune, living out his days simply and modestly among the familiar surroundings of Oxford College. Humphrey Carpenter, who was given unrestricted access to Tolkien's papers, brilliantly puts meat to the bones of the Tolkien legend in <i>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography</i>, offering a well-rounded portrayal of this quiet, bookish man who always saw himself first and foremost as a philologist, uncovering rather than creating the peoples, languages, and adventures of Middle-Earth.<p> Carpenter chronicles Tolkien's early life with a special sensitivity; after losing both parents, Tolkien and his brother Hilary were taken from their idyllic life in the English countryside to a poverty-ridden existence in dark and sooty Birmingham. There were bright points, however. A social and cheerful lad, Tolkien enjoyed rugby and was proud of his gift for languages. It was also at this time that he met Edith Bratt, who would later become his wife. Academic life--both as a student and professor--is where this biography shines. Friendship with other men played a huge part in Tolkien's life, and Carpenter deftly reveals the importance these relationships--his complex friendship with C.S. Lewis, membership in the Inklings and the T.C.B.S.--had on the development of his writing.</p><p> The only criticism one can make about this book is that Carpenter tends to gloss over Tolkien's contributions to comparative philology. True, there is a chapter devoted to Tolkien's academic pursuits, but it tends to skim too lightly over the surface for this reviewer's tastes. Philology is a terribly methodical science, and the author clearly did not want to alienate readers who were primarily interested in Tolkien as a storyteller. Still, it would be nice to understand why Tolkien was held in such high esteem by his fellow academics. As it stands, Tolkien comes off as a slightly eccentric etymologist.</p><p> Fans who want to delve even deeper into Tolkien's life should pick up a copy of Carpenter's <i>The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien</i>. <i>--P.M. Atterberry</i></p>Humphrey Carpenter, the author of THE BRIDESHEAD GENERATION and THE INKLINGS, among other books, was given unrestricted access to all of Tolkien&#39;s papers for his biography of Tolkien, J.R.R.

Dahl, one of the world&#x2019;s most influential and respected political scientists, has spent a lifetime exploring the institutions and practices of democracy in such landmark books as <i>Who Governs?</i>, <i>On Democracy</i>, and <i>How Democratic Is the American Constitution?</i>&nbsp; Here, Dahl looks at the fundamental issue of equality and how and why governments have fallen short of their democratic ideals.&nbsp;<br>At the center of the book is the question of whether the goal of political equality is so far beyond our human limits that it should be abandoned in favor of more attainable ends, or if there are ways to realistically address and reduce inequities. Though complete equality is unattainable, Dahl argues that strides toward that ideal are both desirable and feasible. He shows the remarkable shift in recent centuries toward democracy and political equality the world over. He explores the growth of democratic institutions, the expansion of citizenship, and the various obstacles that stand in the way of gains in political equality. Dahl also looks at the motives, particularly those of emotion and reason, that play such a crucial role in the struggle for equality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In conclusion, Dahl assesses the contemporary political landscape in the United States. He looks at the likelihood of political <i>in</i>equality increasing, and poses one scenario in which Americans grow more unequal in their influence over their government. The counter scenario foresees a cultural shift in which citizens, rejecting what Dahl calls competitive consumerism,&#x201d; invest time and energy in civic action and work to reduce the inequality that now exists among Americans.</p><p><b>Robert A.

It is the most sublime and mature of Teresa of Avila&#39;s works and expresses the full flowering of her deep experience in guiding souls toward spiritual enlightenment. In addition to its profound content, it is a treasury of important maxims on such ascetic subjects as self-knowledge, humility, detachment and suffering. But above all, this account of a soul&#39;s progress in virtue and grace is the record of a life-of the interior life of St. Teresa of Avila, whose soul, mind and temperament hold so deep an attraction for the modern mind. In its central image, Teresa describes the soul &#34;as a castle made of a single diamond in which there are many rooms, just as in Heaven there are many mansions. She describes the various mansions of the castle, the degrees of purgation and strife, through which the soul must pass in its quest for perfection before reaching the innermost chambers, the place of complete transfiguration and communion with God.</p><p>Teresa of Avila was born in Spain.

Many of her photo essays are classics; indeed those on the Louisville Flood and its victims, on the liberation of the Nazi death camps, and on the poverty of India and Pakistan are now part of the iconography of the twentieth century. <p>In this brief collection of her earliest work, two art historians present the "unknown" Bourke-White, the young amateur aged eighteen to twenty-six. Her first photographs, created in 1921 under the tutelage of Columbia University's Clarence H. White, were impeccably designed soft-edged still lifes, "painterly" images characteristic of the period but not of the artist. Bourke-White took this technique to college &#x2013; to the University of Michigan and to Cornell &#x2013; and there made traditional portraits of campus buildings and, almost by accident, her first "industrial" photograph, a Duchamp-like study of loudspeakers. After graduation she moved to Cleveland, where, trembling with fear and aesthetic excitement, she photographed the interior of the Otis Steel Mill, the trestles of the High Level Bridge, and the new Terminal Tower. It was these thrilling Cleveland photographs, made in 1928&#x2013;30, that won her an audience with Luce, who sent her on to <i>Fortune</i> . . . and to fame. </p><p>The eighty photographs reproduced here have seldom been seen outside the archives of Cornell's Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art and the University of Syracuse Library. They will fascinate anyone interested in the life and work of Margaret Bourke-White and the early history of American photojournalism.</p></p><p>In looking at Bourke-White's photographs from her student days and following the scope of her career in photojournalism until her death, it is difficult to believe that all of this was the work a single person. There is a consistent strain throughout her career that can best be described as <i>power</i>. Each picture has this vusal stranth, whether a waterfall or the dramatic incandescent flow of molten steel in a darkened mill. Added to other aspects of her photographic art was her personal will. She established photojournalism standards that became a great gift to journalists of the twentieth century. All of this from Bourke-White, a tiny woman, but a giant among her fellow photojournalists. Her images burned into the memory of Americans for decades of life. This book reveals the foundation of her career. -- <b>Robert J. Doherty</b>, Former Director, George Eastman HouseRonald E.

But what sort of superpower? What role should America play in the world?&nbsp;What role do you want America to play?<br></b><br> Ian Bremmer argues that Washington&#x2019;s directionless foreign policy has become prohibitively expensive and increasingly dangerous. Since the end of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers have stumbled from crisis to crisis in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and Ukraine without a clear strategy. Ordinary Americans too often base their foreign policy choices on allegiance or opposition to the party in power. We can no longer afford this complacency, especially now that both parties are deeply divided about America&#x2019;s role in the world. The next presidential election could easily pit an interventionist Democrat against an isolationist Republican&#x2014;or the exact opposite.<br><br> As 2016 rapidly approaches, Bremmer urges every American to think more deeply about what sort of country America should be and how it should use its superpower status. He explores three options:<br><br><b> Independent America</b> asserts that it&#x2019;s time for America to declare independence from the responsibility to solve other people&#x2019;s problems. Instead, Americans should lead by example&#x2014;in part, by investing in the country&#x2019;s vast untapped potential.<br><br><b> Moneyball America</b> acknowledges that Washington can&#x2019;t meet every international challenge. With a clear-eyed assessment of U.S. strengths and limitations, we must look beyond empty arguments over exceptionalism and American values. The priorities must be to focus on opportunities and to defend U.S. interests where they&#x2019;re threatened.<br><br><b> Indispensable America</b> argues that only America can defend the values on which global stability increasingly depends. In today&#x2019;s interdependent, hyperconnected world, a turn inward would undermine America&#x2019;s own security and prosperity. We will never live in a stable world while others are denied their most basic freedoms&#x2014;from China to Russia to the Middle East and beyond.<br><br>There are sound arguments for and against each of these choices, but we must choose. Washington can no longer improvise a foreign policy without a lasting commitment to a coherent strategy.<br><br> As Bremmer notes, &#x201c;When I began writing this book, I didn&#x2019;t know which of these three choices I would favor. It&#x2019;s easy to be swayed by pundits and politicians with a story to sell or an ax to grind. My attempt to make the most honest and forceful case I could make for each of these three arguments helped me understand what I believe and why I believe it. I hope it will do the same for you. I don&#x2019;t ask you to agree with me. I ask only that you choose.&#x201d;</p><p><b>IAN BREMMER </b>is the president and founder of Eurasia Group, the leading global political risk research and consulting firm.

It begins with an assignment: Tucholsky&#x2019;s publisher wants him to write something light and funny, otherwise about whatever Tucholsky wants. A deal is struck and the story is off: about Peter, a writer; his girlfriend, known as the Princess; and a summer vacation far from the hurly-burly of Berlin. Peter and the Princess have rented a small house attached to a historic castle in Sweden, and they have five weeks of long days and white nights at their disposal; five weeks for swimming and walking and sex and talking and visits with Peter&#x2019;s buddy Karlchen and with Billie, the Princess&#x2019;s best friend. It is perfect, until they meet a weeping girl fleeing the cruel headmistress of a home for children. The vacationers decide they must free the girl and send her back to her mother in Switzerland, which brings about an encounter with authority that casts a worrying shadow over their radiant summer idyll. Soon they must return to Germany. What kind of fairy tale are they living in?</p><p><b>Kurt Tucholsky </b>(1890&#x2013;1935) was born in Berlin to a middle-class Jewish family. He received a law degree from the University of Jena in 1915 and was conscripted to fight in World War I not long after. A notably poor soldier, his aphorism likening soldiers to murderers became a pacifist rallying cry. Tucholsky began his journalism career while still a student, and he found success writing in a range of forms, including the feuilleton, criticism, satire, poetry, and lyrics for cabarets. Under both his name and various pseudonyms, his work frequently appeared in the leftist intellectual organ <i>Die Weltbu&#x308;hne</i> (the World Stage), to which he would contribute on and off for the rest of his life. Tucholsky&#x2019;s collected writings amount to thousands of pages and include a play, <i>Christopher Columbus</i> (1932); an illustrated book, <i>Deutschland, Deutschland u&#x308;ber alles</i> (1929); and two works of fiction, <i>Rheinsberg</i> (1912) and <i>Castle Gripsholm</i> (1931). He was married twice, to Else Weil from 1920 to 1924 and to Mary Gerold in 1924. In 1933, his last piece for <i>Die Weltbu&#x308;hne </i>appeared in January; by August his German citizenship had been annulled and his books burned en masse. The Nazis had denounced him as &#x201c;one of the most wicked of literary pornographers.&#x201d; He divorced Mary to distance her from Nazi persecution and lived in exile in Sweden on short-term visas under threat of deportation, where he died from an overdose of sleeping pills. There are two annual literary awards given in his name: the Swedish PEN Tucholsky Prize and Germany&#x2019;s Kurt Tucholsky Prize.<br><br><b>Michael Hofmann</b> is a German-born, British-educated poet and translator.

Trees so tall they touch the clouds? Amphibians changing into reptiles? These are just a few of the amazing life forms detailed in <i>When Bugs Were Big....</i>This lively new paperback tickles the reader&#x2019;s funny bone while imparting tons of information about the animals, plants, and bugs that lived before the dinosaurs. Children will read "news reports" including a weather forecast from 320 million years ago and an emergency broadcast about the swift extinction that would end the Permian period. As kids peruse Bonner&#x2019;s innovative combination of narrative text, engaging illustrations, hilarious cartoons, maps, charts, and time lines, they will gather lots of valuable scientific information about the amazing creatures that ruled the Earth before the dinosaurs.</p><p>Hannah Bonner was born and raised on the Spanish island of Mallorca, she went to Oberlin College in Ohio, where she studied biology and art. Over the years she managed to bring her two loves together by specialising in natural science illustration. In 2000 she illustrated the best-selling Scholastic Science Dictionary. Shortly thereafter she began writing as well as illustrating.Grade 3-6--Bonner takes a lighthearted approach to a fascinating topic. The Carboniferous and Permian periods spanned 100 million years or so just before the better-known Mesozoic Era. The author describes many of the unusual plant and animal species from those times in a lively, conversational style. Cartoon illustrations decorate every page. Some of them are strictly informational, but most contain elements of humor as well. The facts and the fun work well together, and it's always clear which is which. In one three-panel strip, for example, two scientists offer legitimate theories regarding possible uses of a shark's (Akmonistion) spiny "turret," while a chef wishes that he could have used that unusual appendage as a cheese grater. Weather reports by well-dressed reptile ancestors, want ads for bug-eating amniotes, and pictures with word balloons are among the other comic features. The more straightforward drawings of the unusual creatures are clear and eye-catching, though not all include estimated size. A useful two-page illustrated time line gives a nice overview. Most of the species details are basic, with more emphasis on how life in general evolved during this time period. Readers also see how climate, geology, and other animals effected development. Most dinosaur books include just a page or two of pre-Triassic information, so this title offers valuable subject coverage in an appealing package.--Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Britain stood alone. France feared a major war, and would not help. The USA would not support Britain. Suddenly Adolf Hitler, with whom Prime Minister Chamberlain had negotiated &#39;peace in our time&#39;, and whom the Defence Secretary had called &#39;most sincere&#39;, was revealed for what he was. As impossible as it might seem to us today, within six months of declaring war, Britain was enduring a shattering and devastating experience. And Britain faced massive loss, and surrender. By May 1940 Winston Churchill, then Prime Minister, was being asked to approve plans to evacuate the Government, Royal Family and the Bank of England&#39;s gold to Canada. 200,000 British troops stood on the beaches of Dunkirk, unable to get home, while Churchill bartered with the Americans to send destroyers to help. In the previous six months, children had been evacuated from London and cities; men had been called up and mobilised, and women went to work in munitions factory and did men&#39;s jobs for the first time. People knew their lives would never be the same again. And propaganda was rife. Propaganda works best when the enemy is diminished, and portrayed as a manageable entity, certain to be defeated. Much of German propaganda was sinister, especially in the portrayal of Jewish citizens. American propaganda was cautionary and dark. British propaganda, on the other hand, was that the righteous should prevail and that those in the wrong - be they errant schoolboys, bullies, or robbers, or even wartime leaders, should always fail. Rubbishing the enemy, assassinating nasty characters with humorous methods, was a technique people learned from comics. Britain was expert in this area. So enter Heath Robinson, and R F Paterson&#39;s &#34;Mein Rant&#34;, which we reproduce in this book, with a new introduction by leading comic archivist, Morris Heggie. &#34;Mein Rant&#34; is a clever and funny satire of Hitler&#39;s &#34;Mein Kampf&#34;, illustrated by Heath Robinson. Today, and since World War One, Heath Robinson&#39;s name has been used to describe absurdly complicated inventions that achieved very simple results. Here his work is used to great impact. &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; (&#39;My Struggle&#39;), Hitler&#39;s autobiography, was published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926 which Hitler wrote in Landsberg Prison, and R F Paterson said of it: &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; had neither rhyme nor reason, while my abridgement undoubtedly has rhyme. &#39;A conversion of Hitler&#39;s &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; to a delightful and pungent verse-satire. The result is an absolute triumph of the Comic Muse over intractable, almost hopeless material.&#39; The key points: first published February 1940, humour/nostalgia/war, introduction by Morris Heggie, former editor of &#34;The Dandy&#34; and leading comic archivist.</p><p>R F Paterson was born in Glasgow and worked as an editor. Heath Robinson illustrated many children&#39;s books in the 1930s and became famous for his absurdly complex illustrations of machines and inventions that performed simple tasks.</p><h2>Oracle Bones Divination: The Greek I Ching</h2><p>The first complete guide to this ancient Greek form of divination <br> <br>ï¿½ Explains how to cast and interpret this oracle using either coins or traditional animal bones <br> <br>ï¿½ Reveals how the use of oracle bones predates the I Ching <br> <br>ï¿½ Includes the complete matrix of oracle interpretations reconstructed by the author from stanzas in ancient Greek temples <br> <br>In ancient Greece methods of foretelling the future were widespread, whether they were official oracles of the gods or simple dice games to divine one&#x2019;s luck. One of the most popular and accessible ways of determining one&#x2019;s fate and fortune was through the ritual casting of animal bones, similar to the casting of coins or yarrow stalks with the Chinese I Ching. <br> <br>Kostas Dervenis explains how to interpret the casting of the oracle bones--either traditional sheep anklebones or coins--to answer your questions on love, health, wealth, and the future. Using the original stanzas discovered in ancient Greek temples in Greece and Turkey, the author reconstructs the complete matrix of interpretation for each possible casting of the bones. He explores how this practice traces back to the Golden Age of the Neolithic period in Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria--predating the I Ching--and how it is still practiced today as the popular folk game of &#x201c;knucklebones.&#x201d; <br> <br>Providing the first complete guide to this ancient practice, Dervenis allows anyone to cast the bones for guidance, inspiration, and insight into their fate.</p><p>Kostas Dervenis is a materials engineer and a martial arts instructor in jujutsu and pammachon.

In the spirit of Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, and Helen and Scott Nearing, Coperthwaite has fashioned a livelihood of integrity and completeness&#x2014;buying almost nothing, providing for his own needs, and serving as a guide and companion to hundreds of apprentices drawn to his unique way of being. A Handmade Life carries Coperthwaite&#x2019;s ongoing experiments with hand tools, hand-grown and gathered food, and handmade shelter, clothing, and furnishings out into the world to challenge and inspire. His writing is both philosophical and practical, exploring themes of beauty, work, education, and design while giving instruction on the hand-crafting of the necessities of life. Richly illustrated with luminous color photographs by Peter Forbes, the book is a moving and inspirational testament to a new practice of old ways of life.</p><p>William Coperthwaite is a native of Maine who has traveled the world in search of folk-art techniques and subsistence skills. Impressed by the beauty and intelligence of the traditional central Asian nomadic tents called &#34;yurts,&#34; Coperthwaite adapted and introduced to North America yurt design and construction. In the past four decades has participated in building more than three hundred yurts for family homes, schools, camps, and outbuildings. Awarded a doctorate from Harvard University&#39;s School of Education for his work with Eskimo villagers, Coperthwaite has taught in a variety of innovative educational settings. His organization, the Yurt Foundation, now serves to promote sensible and economical self-reliance through workshops, lectures, and publications.Serene and thoughtful, this rambling scrapbook by Maine native and yurt-house builder Coperthwaite provides a vision of a life lived simply and self-sufficiently. From violence to education to how to build a "democratic chair" or make an axe, Coperthwaite covers an abundance of topics as he describes his version of a "handmade life" and explains why such a life is desirable. Never quite didactic, Coperthwaite meditates on topics-such as the idea of employment as exploitation-more than he preaches about them, moving glibly from idea to disconnected idea. A recipe for "a bread so good to both the palate and to health that a diet of bread and water would be a delight" is placed next to an anecdote about a young Eskimo girl named Maggie, for example. And the author's own poems, along with poems by D.H. Lawrence and Emily Dickinson, intersperse the narrative. Peter Forbes' engaging color photographs illustrate Coperthwaite's concepts-no easy feat given their breadth and diversity. 67 color photos, 10 b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eames</h2><p><strong>Design's dynamic duo: The illustrious career of Charles and Ray Eames</strong> &nbsp; &#x201c;Eventually everything connects&#x2014;people, ideas, objects, etc. ... the quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.&#x201d;<br> -Charles Eames<br> <br> &#x201c;... everything hangs on something else.&#x201d;<br> -Ray Eames<br> <br> Nothing says modernist perfection like an Eames design.

When the doctor gives Cassie only a few weeks to live, Dani and her mother argue about the right way to care for her, and they don't tell her that she is fatally ill. Then Cassie receives a check for $100,000 from an anonymous donor, and Dani makes up her mind that her sister will get her last wish, to see the ocean. Without permission, the sisters and Dani's friend Austin drive to the Florida coast. Dani calls her mother when she learns that Cassie knows the truth about her condition. In the last pages, readers see Dani and her mother continuing their lives without Cassie, both with budding love interests, and watching the loggerhead turtles move towards the ocean in an affirmation of life. The plot is trite and overly sentimental, with obvious twists and a predictable ending.

In <i>An Elegant Madness</i>, Murray examines this polarity, providing readers with an accurate, entertaining, easy-to-read portrayal that conveys the mood of the period, focusing primarily on the oft-paradoxical social practices and attitudes of the English aristocracy.<p> Generally understood as a 50-year period beginning, as with the French Revolution, just before the dawn of the 19th century, Regency England (or, more precisely, its uppermost stata) remained, in many ways, oblivious to and safely distanced from the ravages of the Napoleonic Wars consuming the continent. The tone of society, according to Murray, tends to be set by its titular head; thus, the paradox and political detachment of the Regency Period emanated primarily from its leader, the Prince Regent. The carefree Regent, who would reign as King George IV from 1820 to 1830, was known not only as "The First Gentleman of Europe," but also as a dedicated hedonist, drunkard, and lecher. Elegance and vulgarity characterized the rest of the English aristocracy, as well, and Murray's chapters clearly illustrate how Regency high society appropriated for itself the same duality as their leader's. Her chapters, each a freestanding study of its own, examine fashions of the period, the (exorbitant) cost of living, London high society, clubs and taverns, the common practice of taking a mistress, the country home, and the seaside resort. She embellishes her study with cartoons, prints, and caricatures of the period, all of which contribute to our understanding of this unique period of English history. <i>--Bertina Loeffler Sedlack</i></p>THE REGENCY was one of the most romantic and turbulent ages in British history. Spanning the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, it was an era that witnessed unprecedented industrial progress, artistic accomplishment, violent social unrest, and -- paradoxically -- the most sparkling social scene English high society has ever enjoyed. Under the influence of the excessively fat, loose-moraled Prince of Wales (to whom Jane Austen dedicated Emma), the Regency became the very apex of British decadence. It was a time of lavish parties, ferocious gossip, relentless bed-hopping, and notorious gambling that set a standard for elegance and vulgarity. Venetia Murray uses original material from the archives at Windsor including dozens of contemporary accounts, diaries, letters, memoirs, and menus, as well as rare cartoons and prints, to evoke the period in vivid, delicious detail. At the same time she provides a subtle, smart analysis of the political and economic undercurrents of the social whirl. With many frothy pleasures and unexpected bite, An Elegant Madness is a book that readers will want to devour.</p><h2>Think and Grow Rich</h2><p>Sweet Water Press 477 pages</p><p></p><h2>Chaos of Cults</h2><p>Hardcover, Fourteenth Printing, August, 1954, Revised and Enlarged.

Donzelot also provides a critique of Marxist, psychoanalytic, and feminist conceptions of the family and shows how the policies of the state and the professions molded working-class and middle-class families in quite different ways.</p><p>"An essential corrective both to the old overly optimistic interpretation and to the new pessimistic and apocalyptic vision of the recent history of the family and society in the West."--Lawrence Stone, New Republic</p></p><p><p>A student and colleague of Michel Foucault shows how public intervention in family affairs since the eighteenth century effected radical changes in a traditionally private domain.</p><p>Jacques Donzelot is professor of political science at the University of Paris-X, Nanterres, and an urban planning advisor for the Ministry of Land Management in Paris.

Under his bare feet, the moss of the King's Grove felt cool and welcoming; the fragrance of the summer night, flowers that bloomed at no other time, filled his nostrils. Yet he could not take full pleasure in the soft breeze, the cool moss, the sweet scents. Where was she?<br><br>He had spent the entire short night on the central mound near the Oathstone, expecting the Lady to appear, but she had neither granted his request to come early nor sent a clear refusal. He had hoped to use this auspicious day to ask her once again for help with his continuing effort to reconcile the two peoples, elves and humans . . . but since his coronation she had come seldom, and never for long. The whole night she had been elsewhere, and not even his growing taig-sense could find the direction.<br><br>He looked again at the stars overhead; the ritual must begin when the Summerstar touched the oldest blackoak's crown--and as he watched, the star slid that last short distance.<br><br>"Grandson," the Lady said. "It is time." She was there, where she had not been an instant before, and already she had begun the chant. No time now to remonstrate. He raised his arms high and sang as the sky brightened overhead. Across the Oathstone, she also sang, the two of them--so the tradition went--singing the sun over its midsummer peak. The Lady's hands drew patterns in the air, coils of silvery light, a net to capture the first rays of the sun's gold.<br><br>Kieri suspected she would withdraw into her elvenhome kingdom as soon as it was done, but as her enchantment wrapped around him, his irritation subsided. Her song, her power, held him fast. His mind soared: he knew he was in the place he belonged, performing the rituals he needed to perform. The taig responded to both of them; he felt it in his whole body, a tingling awareness of life that both nourished him and needed him. This was how it should be. But the dawn song and the Lady left him at the same time; her enchantment no longer clouded his awareness, and his resentment returned.<br><br>He knew she would not return until sundown, when they would spend another short night by the Oathstone. This time, he promised himself, she would listen to him. They were co-rulers; she should not ignore the king any more than he should ignore the Lady. She must at least explain why she had been so supportive that quarter-year ago and so ignored him now. Then he put that out of his head; he still had his own duties.<br><br>That morning he walked the bounds of Chaya, retracing the route he'd taken on his coronation day. Once more his subjects lined the streets and the city wall; now he knew many faces and names, and when a child wriggled loose from Berian, baker, and ran to him, he scooped her up.<br><br>"Jerli, where are you going?" Kieri glanced at the child's mother, who stood red-faced a few paces away.<br><br>"Give you Midsummer luck," the child said, pushing a flower behind his ear. Then she planted a wet kiss on his cheek and wriggled to get down. Kieri set her gently on her feet, and Berian snatched her up, face hardening.<br><br>"Don't scold her," Kieri said. "Kind hearts are Arianya's children." His own heart ached, thinking of his lost daughter at that age, who had run to him just as eagerly.<br><br>"If the king doesn't mind--"<br><br>"A child's good wishes? Never." He went on then, pausing at the four cardinal directions to pour a libation and break a loaf. At noon, he went to the royal ossuary to "bring the sun" to the dead with garlands of flowers. The Seneschal had a basket of fresh leaves ready; Kieri laid the leaves on eyeholes, mouths, earholes, and hung the garlands at either end of the ossuary. He felt a welcome from the bones; he sat on the stool the Seneschal placed for him between the platforms, and the Seneschal set the Suncandle before him, its fragrant smoke wreathing about him, then bowed and left Kieri alone. By custom, he would tell the bones how the year went, reassure them or trouble them as it might.<br><br>He had visited the ossuary several times since his coronation, reading over the stories incised on the bones, aware of something he could not define--clouds of feeling from this one and that, not all of them. But always the Seneschal had attended him. This was his first visit truly alone and the first when he had a report to make.<br><br>He let his mind quiet, trying to drive away that persistent resentment of the Lady's neglect, and then began, talking to the bones as if they were living men and women, his ancestors, standing around him. He told of the coronation, of the many conferences with his Council, his assessment of the Siers he had met, his concern about the lack of trade, the slow withering of the land's economy, his concern about the danger from Pargun and what seemed to him an unreasonable aversion to preparations for defense.<br><br>"And the elves and humans are still estranged," he said, into the silent near-darkness. A chill ran down his back, as if behind him someone had stepped out with drawn sword. He felt a tension in the silence: true listening, it seemed. It could not be, he told himself . . . and yet the hairs stood up on his arms. He did not glance around; he would not give in to the fear. "The Lady of the Ladysforest--"<br><br>The Suncandle flared, the flame rising to the level of his knees as he sat on the stool. Kieri felt sweat break out on his forehead. Were elves listening? So much the better, then; perhaps they would carry his message to her. He laid it all out in plain words, in a voice flat with suppressed anger. She was his grandmother and his co-ruler: she owed him the courtesy of her presence and the kingdom the courtesy of her attention and her assistance. She had changed since the coronation, and he did not know why. He was angry, he admitted to the bones, that she had neglected what he saw as her plain duty . . . and yet he was not free to act as he would if he were sole ruler. Even that day, that sacred morn of Midsummer, she had ignored his request and come to the Grove only at the final moment.<br><br>As if physical hands touched his face, he felt something--a warmth on his right cheek, a coolness on his left. Something of his father--the merest hint of a man's firm, warm hand on his sword-side, the merest hint of a woman's softer, cooler hand on his heart-side. His heart stuttered a moment, then beat on. He could not speak aloud; he asked the question in his mind. Are you . . . father? Sister?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>What . . . do you want? From his father's hand--he could not think it otherwise--came a sense of love, support, peace. He could almost smell that dimly remembered smell, from times his father had picked him up and held him close. From his sister's hand, something different: affection, wistfulness, and--stronger as he listened--anger. Then, sudden and strong: betrayal and warning.<br><br>Kieri scarcely breathed. Betrayal? Danger? Who?<br><br>They lie. She-- But that was interrupted; his right cheek seemed to feel more pressure.<br><br>Not now. No shadows this day.<br>The sensation faded, his father's faster than his sister's, leaving the certainty that he had more to learn from them. The final word from his father felt like duty . . . from his sister, like judgment.<br><br>"Sir King."<br><br>Kieri opened eyes he had not realized he'd closed; the Seneschal knelt before him, picking up the Suncandle's holder, in which only a puddle of wax remained.<br><br>"The candle has ended, Sir King."<br><br>"Thank you," Kieri said. He had no idea how long it had burned. "I . . . I will need to talk with you after the rest of this." A wave of the hand encompassed all the Midsummer rituals.<br><br>"I wondered," the Seneschal said. "From my post I saw the Suncandle burn higher than I have ever seen it before. When it flares, sometimes there is a message."<br><br>"There was . . . something," Kieri said. "Something I do not understand, but must." He shook his head to clear it. "Seneschal, do the bones ever speak to you?"<br><br>"Speak to me? You mean, do I hear voices?"<br><br>"I suppose . . . or something, some knowledge you feel the bones are giving you?"<br><br>"That, yes, Sir King. Just as you said you did, on your first visit. Is that not still happening?"<br><br>"Yes. But I do not know . . . how much is real. How much is my wish, or my . . . I was never given to fancies, that I know of."<br><br>"Nor would I think you so, Sir King. You have every aspect of a practical man, a man of experience and action. If your ancestors' bones are telling you something, then to my mind you should listen. I am at your service whenever you wish, but is it so urgent that you must ignore this feast?"<br><br>"No . . . I think not." Kieri sat down on the bench outside the ossuary to put on his boots. "I must come back again, find the time to sit awhile with them, and then--then I will need to ask you how to interpret what I think I hear."<br><br>He found the court waiting for him outside, musicians and all. He led them to feast in the shade of the trees at the edge of the Royal Ride. They ate sitting on the grass, even the stuffiest of the Siers, and watched as a parade of livestock decked with flowers and ribbons, mellow bells around their necks clonking gently, ambled past on the main street. Music eddied in and out of hearing as the breeze shifted: ballads, jigs, round dances.<br><br>"We never did any of this in the north," he said to Arian, one of his half-elven Squires. In the quarter-year since his coronation, he'd found himself attracted to her despite the disparity in their ages and his determination not to involve himself with much younger women. "I wish I'd thought of it." It did no harm to talk to her, he told himself.<br><br>"Were you even there, in Midsummer?" she asked.<br><br>"Not often. I spent the summers in Aarenis." Hot summers those had been, sweat gluing his shirt to his body, sun beating down on his helm. "When we were in a safe camp, I...</p><h2>Quilling: Techniques and Inspiration</h2><p>Easy-to-learn, delightful, decorative results, inexpensive - and fun to do, quilling is the art of rolling, scrolling, coiling and fringing narrow strips of paper to create exquisite designs.</p><p>Jane Jenkins is a former teacher who started a small business with her husband, making and selling paper strips and designs for quilling, books, kits, and videos throughout the world.

A railroad buff since a child, he took strange pleasure in his work as a POW on the Burma-Siam Railroad, which was later the subject of the film Bridge Over the River Kwai. When his captors discovered his detailed drawings of the railway, he was suspected as a spy and tortured for years. Fifty years later he discovered that the interpreter during his tortures was still alive. The two arranged a meeting and Lomax forgave him. Here is the exciting, moving and truthful account.Winner of the 1996 NCR Book Award <br>A naive young man, a radio enthusiast and radio buff, was caught up in the fall of the British Empire at Singapore in 1942. He was put to work on the Railway of Death -- the Japanese line from Thailand and Burma. The most disastrous engineering project in history, it killed 250,000 Allied prisoners and Thai labourers. Lomax helped to build a radio so that he and his comrades could follow news of the war. The radio was discovered and he was brutally tortured. One of his tormentors was a young Japanese interpreter; Lomax never forgot him. Despite an outwardly successful life, Lomax was emotionally ruined by his experiences and could never share them with anyone. Almost fifty years after the war, his life was changed by the discovery that his interrogator, the Japanese interpreter, was still alive.

Dalby reveals that cheese is one of the most ancient of civilized foods, and he suggests that our passion for cheese may even lay behind the early establishment of global trade. </p><p>Packed with entertaining cheese facts, anecdotes, and images, <i>Cheese </i>also</p><p>features a selection of historic recipes. For those who crave a pungent stilton, a creamy brie, or a salty pecorino, <i>Cheese</i> is the perfect snack of a book.</p></p><p><p><b>Andrew Dalby</b> is a linguist, translator and historian based in France. He is the author of many books including <i>Bacchus: A Biography</i>, <i>Flavours of </i><i>Byzantium</i>, <i>Food in the Ancient World from A to </i>Z, and <i>Dangerous </i><i>Tastes: The Story of Spices, </i>which was named Food Book of the Year by the Guild of Food Writers. </p>In this disappointing food biography, historian and translator Dalby (Food in the Ancient World from A to Z) pursues cheese from era to era and across the globe. Though he lacks a narrative, or even an authoritative voice, readers will take away some interesting history and trivia: cheese might be an Iranian invention, King Charles I's court demanded more Cheddar than could be made, and another story for every cheese and cheese-producing region throughout time. As it turns out, however, cheese trivia isn't enough to hold a book together, making this more an encyclopedic, uninvolving work than a cogent history.

He shows it was not the barbarians nor the Protestant Reformation, but the Catholic Faith that made Europe (and the worldwide civilization produced by Europe).

This is a tremendous eye-opener on where we are today and where we must go from here!!</p><p>Hilaire Belloc was born at St. Cloud, France, in 1870.

"What are you going to do the first time a man stalks up to you and puts his hand on you like this?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his touch she went rigid and sucked in an audible gasp of air.

Worse, her mother's business partner, Jordan Hays--a rugged, cynical loner--embodies everything Gabrielle fears . . . and</p><p>What's a girl to do?! When the mother she never knew bequeaths a boomtown bordello and a too-sexy, too-cynical business partner to convent-bred beauty Gabrielle Antoine, she does what any sensible woman would do--she plays the piano in the parlor while her "girls" entertain their "guests." Determined to send the virtuous Gabrielle scurrying back to New Orleans, her new partner, gambler Jordan Hays, embarks on a mission to open her eyes to the seamier, steamier side of life found on the frontier, shocking her to the core with his fiery kisses and caresses that stir unfamiliar, but far from unpleasant feelings in Gabrielle. Much to everyone's surprise, especially Jordan's, Gabrielle refuses to sell out to the unsavory rival who operates a string of gambling dens and whorehouses under deplorable conditions and who murdered Gabrielle's mother to get his hands on Celeste's Place, the grandest brothel in Central City, Colorado. Now in danger, Gabrielle finds herself under the protective wing of Jordan, the loner whose heart has been locked away since experiencing unspoken atrocities during the Civil War. But Gabrielle's innocence and determination stir Jordan's long-lost sense of chivalry, while her beauty stirs his slumbering libido. And Gabrielle is swept away by the depth of her passion for the rugged Jordan. The gambler and the ingenue join forces to fend off a hostile takeover and to search for a lost gold mine, falling in love along the way. The historical accuracy and detail of <i>The Bequest</i> place Candice Proctor in the same category with romance author Susan Johnson, whose attention to non-fictional detail makes every novel a learning experience. Proctor's follow-up to her well-received debut, <i>Night in Eden</i>, is another knockout! <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>This is the second book we&#39;ve published by this fabulous author, but it was actually written before &#34;Night in Eden&#34; which is Candice&#39;s debut novel. The setting of Colorado in the late 1800&#39;s is more traditional than the Australian setting of &#34;Night in Eden,&#34; but this book still has a lot of the elements that I loved about Candice&#39;s first book and that I love about historical romance in general--a strong, intelligent heroine, a sexy and mysterious hero, a lot of emotion, passion and action. And I have to say, the villain in this book is about the meanest, most evil villain I&#39;ve ever encountered in romance. This book proved for me that one of Candice&#39;s greatest talents as a writer is an ability to make the reader feel like she is actually there. So if you&#39;ve ever been curious about what it would be like to live in a brothel, check out &#34;The Bequest!&#34;</p><h2>Mussolini : A New Life</h2><p>Of the four great European dictators of the 20th century, Mussolini remains the least known. The last major, non-academic life, by Denis Mack Smith, has been in print for 20 years, but since its publication much new material has emerged, particularly letters. However it is a minefield for any historian as there have been many attempts to falsify the record with forged material. <p>Nicholas Farrell was a DAILY TELEGRAPH journalist in the second half of the 1990s and spent time investigating the forgeries and writing about the resurgence of Mussolini's reputation, fifty years after his death. </p><p>Whereas Mack Smith painted Mussolini as a dyed-in-the wool villain, Farrell takes a different view. He is more positive, and he shows how Italy was changed very much for the better until Mussolini's final and disastrous decision to join the Axis and support Hitler. Could he have followed Franco's example and stayed on the sidelines? It is one of the questions Farrell examines.</p><p>This new life of Mussolini also launches a talented biographer.</p></p><p>Nicholas Farrell, a former Daily Telegraph journalist, now contributes to the Spectator. He wrote this life of Mussolini living in Italy.A former journalist for the Daily Telegraph brings new light to Mussolini's political contributions and his embattled conscience in this absorbing and fresh biography of the man who created, and then lost control of, the Fascist movement. Farrell follows his subject's numerous underlings and mistresses to piece together a portrait untainted by the maniacal persona Mussolini has inherited from history. This balanced perspective opens the door for an updated look at European Fascism and Anti-Semitism, one that will be useful to understanding the bloody chess game Europe's foreign ministers and military commanders played during the two World Wars. Farrell seems committed to exonerating Il Duce from complicity with Hitler's crimes, going so far as to argue that, while "the French had been only too willing to round up the Jews," Mussolini and his officers went out of their way to save the Jewish people in their territories. Still, Farrell's greatest feat is his iconoclastic analysis of Fascism's socialist origins and its contemporary rivalry with democracy as it tried to plot a "Third Way" between capitalism and communism. Soberly countenancing the moral relativity of power in the modern epoch, Farrell recounts Mussolini's life with precision and detail. Though long and complex, this new reading of Italy's most infamous leader and his place in history's most violent chapter is an original and important work. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Readers will be shocked and dismayed to discover that psychiatry, in the name of helping others, has actually been helping itself.In a style reminiscent of Ben Goldacre&#x2019;s Bad Science and investigative in tone, James Davies reveals psychiatry&#x2019;s hidden failings and how the field of study must change if it is to ever win back its patients&#x2019; trust.</p><p>James Davies attained his PhD in social and medical anthropology at Oxford. He is a practicing psychological therapist as well as the author of The Importance of Suffering: Emotions in the Field; and The Making of Psychotherapists. He has lectured at Harvard, Brown, the New School, Yale, and Oxford. James lives in England.Davies, a social anthropologist and psychotherapist, takes on psychiatry and its bible, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), in the wake of the release of that book&#x2019;s controversial fifth edition. Davies notes that psychiatry was once only for the &#x201c;most distressed members of society.&#x201d; No more. In 2011, Americans filled 254 million prescriptions for antidepressants, which, he writes, largely work because of the placebo effect, while some doctors who tout their benefits are consultants to drug companies. The number of mental disorders in the manual has increased from 106 in 1952 to 372 today, which has been referred to as &#x201c;diagnosis inflation.&#x201d; Davies&#x2019; hypothesis is that &#x201c;psychiatry, by progressively lowering the bar for what counts as mental disorder, has recast many natural responses to the problems of living as mental disorders requiring psychiatric treatment.&#x201d; He is so outspoken about his negative feelings that at a university gala, a cardiologist asked him if he was a Scientologist. This thought-provoking book will make people think twice before sitting on a psychiatrist&#x2019;s couch or filling a prescription. --Karen Springen</p><h2>Gardening in the Southwest: A Wealth of Great Ideas for Your Garden</h2><p>Perfect for gardeners from Texas to California, a complete guide to regional landscaping offers specially tailored layouts with an eye toward the cultural backdrop of the region, with accents and structures that are perfectly tailored for a distinctive southwestern style.

Something in her tone enraged him&#x2014;he was always on the brink of fury&#x2014;and, as she put down one of the slopping pails in the muddy patch before the tumbledown building, the rough wooden door banged open and the woodcutter surged out, his dirty shirt half open, his thick trousers flapping. He grabbed her free arm to hold her steady and slapped her hard, across the face. She reeled back from the blow, but gritted her jaw against the pain, and stood, head bowed, like a beaten ox.<br> <br>He brought his head close to hers and shouted, his spittle spraying into her impassive face. He let her go, and impulsively kicked over both pails into the mud; she would have to go to the stream again, and haul more water. He laughed, as if the thought of her pointless labor was the only funny thing in this bitterly hard world. But then his laughter died as he looked at her.<br> <br>She was not pressing her slapped cheek with the cold palm of her hand, nor bowing her head in sobs. She was not shrinking from him, nor picking up the rolling, empty buckets. She had spread out her hands wide; she was snapping her fingers as if to a drumbeat that only she could hear.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; he demanded. &#x201c;Woman? Fool? What d&#x2019;you think you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes were closed as if she could sense nothing but a smooth wooden floor and clean limewashed walls and candlelight, and the fresh smell of a swept barn ready for a midsummer dance. Her head was tipped, as if listening to the rattle of a tambourine and the tempting, irresistible saw of a fiddler. As he watched, quite bemused, she lifted the hem of her ragged dress, spread it wide, and started to dance, as pretty as a girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll dance you!&#x201d; He started toward her, but she did not shrink from him. She took three steps to the left and did a little jump, then three steps to the right. She turned round as if she were being spun by an attentive partner. Ignoring the icy mud on her bare feet, she started the part of the dance where the women circle the room, as if she were being watched by admirers, her head held high, her eyes blind to the leafless branches of the trees and the cold sky above them.<br> <br>He laid heavy hands on her shoulders and felt her jig beneath his grip as if he were about to dance with her. He tried to drag her into their hut, but she only danced toward the open door, bowed to the dirty interior, and danced back out again. He drew back his fist to thump her into unconsciousness, but something in her smiling, bland face made him hesitate: suddenly powerless, his hand fell to his side.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gone mad,&#x201d; he said wonderingly. &#x201c;A madwoman you&#x2019;ve always been, but now you&#x2019;ve lost your wits, and you&#x2019;ll be the ruin of us all.&#x201d;</p><h2>Living Well Is the Best Revenge (Modern Library)</h2><p>In this enchanting memoir, New Yorker writer Calvin Tomkins re-creates the privileged world of Gerald and Sara Murphy, two American originals who found themselves at the center of a charmed circle of artists and expatriate writers in France in the 1920s.

Edited by Bradbury authorities Donn Albright and Jon Eller, A Pleasure to Burn is the ideal companion to this cultural benchmark. Set in the same universe, this brand new collection of 16 vintage Bradbury short stories charts, dissects and expands upon the ideas that found their purest, most potent expression in Fahrenheit 451. Some of the stories, such as &#34;The Pedestrian&#34; and &#34;Pillars of Fire,&#34; will be familiar to the author&#39;s long-time fans, while others, such as &#34;The Bonfire&#34; and &#34;The Reincarnate,&#34; are more obscure. But the true heart of the collection is the two novellas &#34;Long After Midnight&#34; (previously unavailable for mass consumption) and &#34;The Fireman,&#34; the immediate precursor to the full-length novel. Together these independent, brilliantly original tales form an invaluable Bradbury sourcebook and a unique glimpse into the mysteries of the creative process. At once surprising, illuminating and highly entertaining, A Pleasure to Burn is a must-read for Bradbury scholars, aficionados and casual readers alike.</p><p></p><h2>Ladies Almanack (American Literature)</h2><p>&#34;Now this be a Tale of as fine a Wench as ever wet Bed . . .

It&#39;s a lively lampoon of her lesbian chums of Left Bank Paris in the 1920s. The main character, Dame Evangeline Musset, is based on the notorious dyke Natalie Barney. Structured as a month-by-month almanac in a style that owes as much to Shakespeare&#39;s comedies as to any literature of the intervening centuries, Barnes&#39;s book follows the Dame&#39;s amorous, often naughty, adventures.Djuna Barnes (1892-1982) was born in Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY, and worked as a journalist in New York before leaving the country to spend many years in Paris and London. She returned to New York in 1941, and lived in Greenwich Village until her death.</p><h2>The Debut</h2><p>Although Ruth Weiss at forty is the picture of a scholarly professor of English, at twenty she briefly tasted the romantic life, much like her beloved heroines, Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary</p><p>"Precise and haunting...Brookner is a master at creating miniaturist portraits of attenuated lives"<p>-- The New York Times</p><p>"An almost flawless novel." -- People</p><p>"Sly, detached humor has caused Brookner to be compared to Barbara Pym, but her vision is darker and more complex ....

Pyle was right; on April 18th, a Japanese machine gunner killed one of America's most beloved personalities, sending the entire nation into shock and mourning. In the years since Pyle's death, his particular brand of journalism has been criticized: he's been accused of ignoring the stupidity of generals, of downplaying the horror of battle, and of presenting the war in a better light than it actually deserved to be portrayed. James Tobin, author of the impressive biography <i>Ernie Pyle's War</i>, does not deny that his subject often smoothed the jagged facts of war, but he provides both the context--an era and a war in which correspondents were expected to be "team players" who helped their side to win hearts and minds at home--and the personal conflict raised for Pyle by the often irreconcilable demands of telling the truth and building morale. <p> In addition to detailing Pyle's mostly unhappy personal life, Tobin also includes samples of his columns, proving once and for all that Pyle was more than just a hick who fell into reporting; the man had real, substantial talent, evidenced by his ability to put words together and his sensitivity to the subjects he wrote about. More than just a biography, <i>Ernie Pyle's War</i> is also a study of war, and the peculiar, twilight world of suffering and half-told truths to which men like Ernie Pyle were drawn.</p>"If you think Ernie Pyle is ancient history, think again. Barely half a century ago he was one of the most famous people in America. The columns he wrote were read by millions, anticipated and revered as though they were regular bulletins from a sacred source. . . . What he called his 'worm's-eye' view of combat set a standard for war reporting that remains influential unto this day. . . . A thorough, sympathetic, and revealing book."--Jonathan Yardley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i> <p>"A portrait of a complex, enormously gifted but tortured writer, entrapped and ultimately driven to death by a sense of obligation to the image he inadvertently created of himself. It is undoubtedly the best biography of Ernie Pyle ever written, but it is much more; few books about combat journalism have so vividly depicted the fascinating interactions between war correspondents and the folks back home. . . . World War II was quintessentially Ernie Pyle's war, and Tobin brilliantly explains why."--Malcolm W. Browne, <i>New York Times Book Review</i> </p><p>"A fine and fascinating new biography. Pyle didn't write about warriors and generals and lofty subjects like global affairs. He produced wonderful stories about plumbers and teachers and mechanics and all sorts of regular guys who, due to circumstances they had no control over, went to war and then did their best to win and come home alive."--Daniel LeDuc, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> </p><p>"A wonderfully crafted biography."--William Prochnau, author of <i>Once Upon a Distant War</i> </p><p>"Ernie Pyle showed everybody else the way. He was a hell of a reporter."--Charles Kuralt</p></p><h2>My Friend Hitler</h2><p>Though best known for his novels, Yukio Mishima published more than sixty plays, almost all of which were produced during his lifetime. Among them are kabuki plays and others inspired by No dramas&#x2015;two types used in classical Japanese theater. Of play-writing Mishima once observed, "I started writing dramas just as water flows toward a lower place. In me, the topography of dramas seems to be situated far below that of novels. It seems to be in a place which is more instinctive, closer to child's play." For English readers, these plays have been one of Japan's best-kept secrets&#x2015;until now.<br><br>In this anthology, Hiroaki Sato translates the brilliance and richness of Yukio Mishima's writing into the English language. He has selected five major plays and three essays on dramaturgy, providing informative introductions to guide the reader. Sato's translations offer a broad historical and personal context in which those new to Mishima's work can place his writing. For those more familiar with Mishima, these translations offer another medium in which one can access his ingenious work.</p><p>Acclaimed Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima (1925&#x2013;1970) was also a prolific playwright, penning more than sixty plays, nearly all of which were produced in his lifetime. Hiroaki Sato is the first to translate these plays into English. For this collection he has selected five major plays and three essays Mishima wrote about drama. The title play is a satire that follows the breakdown of friendship between Adolf Hitler and two Nazi officials who were ultimately assassinated under orders from Hitler.Yukio Mishima is widely celebrated as one of the most talented Japanese writers of the twentieth century. A proponent of bushido, the samurai code, and an interpreter of Western style, Mishima drew from both modern and ancient literary and dramatic styles to inspire his writing. Three times nominated for the Nobel Prize, Yukio Mishima published numerous poems, essays, short stories, and novels. He is most famous for his tetralogy <i>Sea of Fertility</i> that was completed the day he performed seppuku, a ritualistic samurai suicide, in 1970.Hiroaki Sato has won prizes for <i>Breeze Through Bamboo: Kanshi of Ema Saiko</i> (Columbia, 1997) and, with Burton Watson, for <i>From the Country of Eight Islands: An Anthology of Japanese Poetry</i> (Columbia, 1986).

Because the statute of limitations on espionage had run out, he was convicted only of perjury. Decades later&#x2014;after the Hiss trial had been long forgotten by most&#x2014;archival evidence surfaced confirming the accusations: a public servant with access to classified documents had indeed passed crucial information to the Soviets for more than a decade.</b></i> <br><br>Yet many on the American Left still consider Hiss an iconic figure&#x2014;an innocent victim accused of unsubstantiated crimes. They prefer to focus on the collectivist ideals Hiss stood for, rather than confront the reality of a man who systematically and methodically betrayed his country. <br><br>Former U.S. Intelligence analyst Christina Shelton employs an in-depth knowledge of Soviet intelligence affairs as well as recently released Hungarian and KGB archival material to shine a fresh light on one of the most famous espionage cases. The story is dramatic, but Shelton&#x2019;s analysis goes beyond sensationalism as she explores both the ideological motivation behind Hiss&#x2019;s behavior and the lasting influence it has had on U.S. foreign policy. <br><br>Why exactly were the intellectual elite so deter-mined that Hiss was innocent? His accuser, <i>Time </i>magazine senior editor Whittaker Chambers&#x2014;originally Hiss&#x2019;s Soviet handler&#x2014;presented compelling written evidence. However, the intelligentsia were intent on supporting one of their own. They ignored the facts, a willful blindness that helped contribute to a polarization still in place in our country today. <br><br>Thirty years of intelligence analysis gives Shelton the expertise to approach the story from many different angles, especially: <br><br>ï¿½ Her persuasive argument that Communism and Fascism are not polar opposites, as has so long been claimed, but highly similar ideologies. <br><br>ï¿½ How Hiss&#x2019;s central role at the Yalta Conference and the founding of the United Nations are examples of the significance of Soviet intelligence recruitment of high-level Americans who could influence U.S. foreign policy in their favor. <br><br>ï¿½ Why the silence surrounding the implications of Hiss&#x2019;s espionage continues&#x2014;and why apologists fear that smearing his name would undercut New Deal policies and the United Nations. Shelton doesn&#x2019;t just detail the body of evidence pointing to Hiss&#x2019;s guilt; she suggests new layers of meaning in light of the current political landscape. <br><br>Today, the importance of understanding Hiss&#x2019;s ideological commitment has never been more vital. His advocacy of collectivism and internationalism still resonate among the political elite, making this book an important and timely analysis of American thought at this critical juncture in our country&#x2019;s life.</p><p><b>Christina Shelton</b> is a retired U.S. intelligence analyst.

Her first assignment is to read and report on <i>Sweet Blasphemy</i>, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mirï¿½rors her own and that Zahara&#x2014;like Shams&#x2014;has come to set her free.</p><p><b>Elif Shafak</b> is an award-winning bestselling novelist and the most widely read female writer in Turkey.

At last I realized that they did not see....</i></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><b>-SHAMS OF TABRIZ</b><p></p><p><b>Prologue</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>B</b>etween your fingers you hold a stone and throw it into flowing water. The effect might not be easy to see. There will be a small ripple where the stone breaks the surface and then a splash, muffled by the rush of the surrounding river. That&#x2019;s all.</p><p>Throw a stone into a lake. The effect will be not only visible but also far more lasting. The stone will disrupt the still waters. A circle will form where the stone hit the water, and in a flash that circle will multiply into another, then another. Before long the ripples caused by one plop will expand until they can be felt everywhere along the mirrored surface of the water. Only when the circles reach the shore will they stop and die out.</p><p>If a stone hits a river, the river will treat it as yet another commotion in its already tumultuous course. Nothing unusual. Nothing unmanageable.</p><p>If a stone hits a lake, however, the lake will never be the same again.</p><p>For forty years Ella Rubinstein&#x2019;s life had consisted of still waters&#x2014;a predictable sequence of habits, needs, and preferences. Though it was monotonous and ordinary in many ways, she had not found it tiresome. During the last twenty years, every wish she had, every person she befriended, and every decision she made was filtered through her marriage. Her husband, David, was a successful dentist who worked hard and made a lot of money. She had always known that they did not connect on any deep level, but connecting emotionally need not be a priority on a married couple&#x2019;s list, she thought, especially for a man and a woman who had been married for so long. There were more important things than passion and love in a marriage, such as understanding, affection, compassion, and that most godlike act a person could perform, forgiveness. Love was secondary to any of these. Unless, that is, one lived in novels or romantic movies, where the protagonists were always larger than life and their love nothing short of legend.</p><p>Ella&#x2019;s children topped her list of priorities. They had a beautiful daughter in college, Jeannette, and teenage twins, Orly and Avi. Also, they had a twelve-year-old golden retriever, Spirit, who had been Ella&#x2019;s walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since he&#x2019;d been a puppy. Now he was old, overweight, completely deaf, and almost blind; Spirit&#x2019;s time was coming, but Ella preferred to think he would go on forever. Then again, that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything, be it a habit, a phase, or a marriage, even when the end stood right in front of her, plain and inevitable.</p><p>The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a large Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid, with five bedrooms, three baths, shiny hardwood floors, a three-car garage, French doors, and, best of all, an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance, car insurance, retirement plans, college savings plans, joint bank accounts, and, in addition to the house they lived in, two prestigious apartments: one in Boston, the other in Rhode Island. She and David had worked hard for all this. A big, busy house with children, elegant furniture, and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a clichï¿½ to some people, but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most, if not all, of their dreams.</p><p>On their last Valentine&#x2019;s Day, her husband had given her a heart-shaped diamond pendant and a card that read,</p><p></p><p>To my dear Ella,</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>A woman with a quiet manner, a generous heart, and the patience of a saint. Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for being my wife.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Yours,</p><p>David</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ella had never confessed this to David, but reading his card had felt like reading an obituary. This is what they will write about me when I <i>die,</i> she had thought. And if they were sincere, they might also add this:</p><p><i>Building her whole life around her husband and children, Ella lacked any survival techniques to help her cope with life&#x2019;s hardships on her own. She was not the type to throw caution to the wind. Even changing her daily coffee brand was a major effort.</i></p><p>All of which is why no one, including Ella, could explain what was going on when she filed for divorce in the fall of 2008 after twenty years of marriage.</p><p>But there was a reason: love.</p><p>They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent. The two of them were not only miles apart but also as different as day and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible for them to bear each other&#x2019;s presence, never mind fall in love. But it happened. And it happened fast, so fast in fact that Ella had no time to realize what was happening and to be on guard, if one could ever be on guard against love.</p><p>Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.</p><p><b>Ella</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>NORTHAMPTON, MAY 17, 2008</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>B</b>irds were singing outside her kitchen window on that balmy day in spring. Afterward Ella replayed the scene in her mind so many times that, rather than a fragment from the past, it felt like an ongoing moment still happening somewhere out there in the universe.</p><p>There they were, sitting around the table, having a late family lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Her husband was filling his plate with fried chicken legs, his favorite food. Avi was playing his knife and fork like drumsticks while his twin, Orly, was trying to calculate how many bites of which food she could eat so as not to ruin her diet of 650 calories a day. Jeannette, who was a freshman at Mount Holyoke College nearby, seemed lost in her thoughts as she spread cream cheese on another slice of bread. Also at the table sat Aunt Esther, who had stopped by to drop off one of her famous marble cakes and then stayed on for lunch. Ella had a lot of work to do afterward, but she was not ready to leave the table just yet. Lately they didn&#x2019;t have too many shared family meals, and she saw this as a golden chance for everyone to reconnect.</p><p>&#x201c;Esther, did Ella give you the good news?&#x201d; David asked suddenly. &#x201c;She found a great job.&#x201d;</p><p>Though Ella had graduated with a degree in English literature and loved fiction, she hadn&#x2019;t done much in the field after college, other than editing small pieces for women&#x2019;s magazines, attending a few book clubs, and occasionally writing book reviews for some local papers. That was all. There was a time when she&#x2019;d aspired to become a prominent book critic, but then she simply accepted the fact that life had carried her elsewhere, turning her into an industrious housewife with three kids and endless domestic responsibilities.</p><p>Not that she complained. Being the mother, the wife, the dog walker, and the housekeeper kept her busy enough. She didn&#x2019;t have to be a breadwinner on top of all these. Though none of her feminist friends from Smith College approved of her choice, she was satisfied to be a stay-at-home mom and grateful that she and her husband could afford it. Besides, she had never abandoned her passion for books and still considered herself a voracious reader.</p><p>A few years ago, things had begun to change. The children were growing up, and they made it clear that they didn&#x2019;t need her as much as they once had. Realizing that she had too much time to spare and no one to spend it with, Ella had considered how it might be to find a job. David had encouraged her, but though they kept talking and talking about it, she rarely pursued the opportunities that came her way, and when she did, potential employers were always looking for someone younger or more experienced. Afraid of being rejected over and over, she had simply let the subject drop.</p><p>Nevertheless, in May 2008 whatever obstacle had impeded her from finding a job all these years unexpectedly vanished. Two weeks shy of her fortieth birthday, she found herself working for a literary agency based in Boston. It was her husband who found her the job through one of his clients&#x2014;or perhaps through one of his mistresses.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; Ella rushed to explain now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only a part-time reader for a literary agent.&#x201d;</p><p>But David seemed determined not to let her think too little of her new job. &#x201c;Come on, tell them it&#x2019;s a well-known agency,&#x201d; he urged, nudging her, and when she refused to comply, he heartily agreed with himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a prestigious place, Esther. You should see the other assistants! Girls and boys fresh out of the best colleges. Ella is the only one going back to work after being a housewife for years. Now, isn&#x2019;t she something?&#x201d;</p><p>Ella wondered if, deep inside, her husband felt guilty about keeping her away from a career, or else about cheating on her&#x2014;these being the only two explanations she could think of as to why he was now going overboard in his enthusiasm.</p><p>Still smiling, David concluded, &#x201c;This is what I call chutzpah. We&#x2019;re all proud of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She is a prize. Always was,&#x201d; said Aunt Esther in a voice so sentimental that it sounded as if Ella had left the table and was gone for good.</p><p>They all gazed at her lovingly. Even Avi didn&#x2019;t make a cynical remark, and Orly for once seemed to care about something other than her looks. Ella forced herself to appreciate this moment of kindness, but she felt an overwhelming exhaustion that she had never experienced before. She secretly prayed for someone to change the subject.</p><p>Jeannette, her older daughter, must have heard the prayer, for she suddenly chimed in, &#x201c;I have some good news, too.&#x201d;</p><p>All heads turned toward her, faces beaming with expectation.</p><p>&#x201c;Scott and I have decided to get married,&#x201d; Jeannette announced. &#x201c;Oh, I know what you guys are going to say! That we haven&#x2019;t finished college yet and all that, but you&#x2019;ve got to understand, we both feel...</p></p><h2>The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentices: A Season in the Kitchen at Ferran Adriï¿½&#39;s elBulli</h2><p>What goes on behind the scenes at elBulli? Elected best restaurant in the world by <i>Restaurant </i>magazine an unprecedented five times, elBulli is where chef Ferran Adriï¿½'s remarkable cuisine comes to life--with dragon cocktails that make the drinker breathe smoke and caviar made from tiny spheres of olive oil. elBulli is also the object of culinary pilgrimage--millions clamor every year for a reservation at one of its tables. Yet few people know that, behind each of the thirtyor more courses that make up a meal at elBulli, a small army of stagiaires--apprentice chefs--labor at the precise, exhausting work of executing Adriï¿½'s astonishing vision. In <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentices: A Season in the Kitchen at Ferran Adriï¿½'s elBulli, </i>Lisa Abend explores the remarkable system that Adriï¿½ uses to run his restaurant and, in the process, train the next generation of culinary stars. Granted more access to Adriï¿½ and the elBulli kitchen than any other writer in the restaurant's history, Abend follows thirty-five young men and women as they struggle to master the cutting-edge techniques, grueling hours, furious creativity, and interpersonal tensions that come with working at this celebrated institution. Her lively narrative captures a great cast, including a young Korean cook who camps on the doorstep of elBulli until he is allowed to work in the kitchen; an ambitious chef from one of Switzerland's top restaurants struggling to create his own artistic vision of cuisine; and an American couple whose relationship may not withstand the unique pressures of the restaurant. What emerges is an irresistible tale of aspiring young talents caught, for good or ill, in the opportunity of a lifetime.Taken together, their stories form a portrait of the international team that helps make a meal at elBulli so memorable. They also reveal a Ferran Adriï¿½ few ever see, one who is not only a genius chef and artist but also a boss, teacher, taskmaster, businessman, and sometimes- flawed human being. Today, food has become the focus of unprecedented attention, and <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentices </i>also explores the strange evolution--in less than two decades--of a once-maligned profession into a source of celebrity.</p><p>Lisa Abend is journalist based in Madrid. Since 2005, she has been Time magazine's correspondent in Spain. She also contributes to a number of newspapers and magazines, including <i>The Atlantic</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>,<i> The Economist, Food and Wine</i>, <i>The Nation, Saveur</i>, <i>AFAR, Wired</i>, and <i>Slate</i>. In a previous life, she was a professor of European history at Oberlin College.<p> <b> <b>one ]</b> <br> <br> <b>June, or the Machine</b> </b> </p><p>&#x201c;<b>Q</b><i>uemo. Quemo. Quemo, quemo, quemo. Quemo. QUE-mo!&#x201d;</i> </p><p>The most important thing the stagiaires learn on their first day at elBulli is this word: <i>quemo.</i> Literally, it means &#x201c;I burn.&#x201d; The ones who don&#x2019;t speak Spanish don&#x2019;t know that, however, and so, as they mouth the strange word in the early days before it becomes reflex, it comes out a question, one often formed, it seems, in their own language: Kay-moh? Quï¿½meau? </p><p>At the restaurant, <i>quemo</i> is an all-purpose warning: behind you, coming through, hot stuff, watch your back. There is no room for variation in this kitchen, where forty-five chefs and cooks and stagiaires and dishwashers from different countries are constantly moving, and so one word must carry the burden of many kinds of caution. If you listen closely, you&#x2019;ll hear it in the background of the louder, more obvious din created by the Thermomix whirring and coconuts being cracked and orders being fired and marrow bones being sawed apart and the occasional plate crashing to the floor. It is always there, like a looped soundtrack, this steady chorus of <i>quemo</i>s. </p><p>The cooks are supposed to say the word as they round the treacherous bend between the small kitchen and the main one or step through the portal that divides the hot stations from the cold&#x2014;an alert on a blind curve. Some, however, repeat it as they pass through any crowded area of the kitchen, rhythmically announcing each step&#x2014; <i>&#x201c;QUEmoQUEmoQUEmo&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;so that the word becomes a mantra against accidental bumping and other calamities. Admittedly, this produces something of a boy-who-cried-wolf situation: how do you know when something really <i>is</i> hot? For that, the kitchen has spontaneously devised variations: <i>quemo mucho</i> for when a cook takes a hot pan from the flattop and turns around to empty its contents at his station&#x2014;in other words, when something really <i>is</i> hot. </p><p>Except for when it isn&#x2019;t. Aitor Zabala, the chef de partie of Cold Station, says, &#x201c;<i>Quemo mucho</i>&#x201d; as he takes a tray of Ponds, delicate glass bowls of ice that will become one of this year&#x2019;s stellar dishes, and moves them from one freezer to another. In other words, he says <i>&#x201c;Quemo mucho&#x201d;</i> not when he is burning a lot but when he is freezing. The other variations are a little more reliable: <i>quemo mï¿½ximo</i> is used for pots of boiling oil and other potentially disfiguring substances. And this being elBulli, at least twice a day comes the warning <i>quemo nitro,</i> as two of the cooks&#x2014;protective goggles strapped to their heads, a cloud of smoke trailing behind them&#x2014;haul a tank of liquid nitrogen back to the cold station. </p><p><i>Quemo</i> has its personal variations as well. Katie Button never completely loses the querulous tone of the first day; for her, <i>quemo</i> will always be a question. Luke Jang puts the accent on the second syllable, which has the effect, like so much of what he does, of making his version seem faster, more efficient. For Luis Arrufat, <i>quemo</i> is a kind of personal manifesto, a bellowed <i>I am here!,</i> as if he were the lead in a musical who, having already walked onstage and puffed out his chest, still feels the need to signal that he is about to commence singing. The chefs de cuisine, Eduard Xatruch and Oriol Castro, get away with not saying it at all; it&#x2019;s a sign of their authority that they can assume that any person with whom they might collide will say it first. When they do use the word, it carries a distinctly didactic tone, as if to say, &#x201c;Remember? This is how you&#x2019;re supposed to do it.&#x201d; Ferran doesn&#x2019;t have to say &#x201c;<i>Quemo&#x201d;</i> either, of course, but he often does, accompanying it with a swift flick of his hands, so that it takes on a meaning unique to him: <i>Would you please get the hell out of my way?</i> </p><p>The stagiaires learn another word today, too: <i>oï¿½do,</i> or &#x201c;heard.&#x201d; Used the way an English speaker might say &#x201c;roger,&#x201d; <i>oï¿½do</i> is an acknowledgment that you&#x2019;ve heard what the speaker has said. At elBulli, <i>&#x201c;oï¿½do&#x201d;</i> is what you say when you are chef de partie and the person expediting has just called an order that will come from your station&#x2014;you&#x2019;re acknowledging that you heard the request, and you&#x2019;ve started working on it. But since <i>oï¿½do</i> is a hierarchical signifier&#x2014;you say it only to those above you&#x2014;the stagiaires say the word a lot more than anyone else. After all, they are the ones doing the restaurant&#x2019;s grunt work&#x2014;cleaning schmutz from the rabbit ears that will be fried into something resembling potato chips, splitting open tuna spines to release the translucent blob of marrow, turning dozens of pieces of rhubarb into something resembling sea cucumbers. </p><p>When the stagiaires receive instruction or criticism (<i>We need more ears. You call that a sea cucumber? That&#x2019;s a fucking zucchini!</i>), they are supposed to reply with <i>&#x201c;Oï¿½do&#x201d;</i>&#x2014;I heard you, got it, I&#x2019;m on it. Sometimes Ferran will make a suggestion to the group and then, like a mostly benevolent drill sergeant and his &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t HEAR you!,&#x201d; will ask, <i>&#x201c;Oï¿½do, cocina?&#x201d;</i> On those occasions the stagiaires will respond in unison with their own robust <i>&#x201c;Oï¿½do!&#x201d;</i> But usually the word is uttered by an individual, with varying intonations of enthusiasm or resentment, to demonstrate that he understands what the next task is. For despite the fact that many of them have cooked in important restaurants around the globe&#x2014;Tetsuya&#x2019;s, noma, the French Laundry, Alain Ducasse&#x2014;the thirty-two stagiaires in elBulli&#x2019;s kitchen are now on the bottom rung of the most famous restaurant in the world. And on the bottom rung, there is always something else to do. </p><p>A table at elBulli is the holy grail of reservations for food lovers around the world, but a <i>stage</i> there is even more desirable for young, ambitious cooks. Each year, roughly three thousand apply for the privileged opportunity of passing six months as stagiaires&#x2014;technically the word means &#x201c;interns&#x201d; or &#x201c;apprentices,&#x201d; but it translates metaphorically as &#x201c;kitchen slaves&#x201d;&#x2014;at its stove tops. The high regard in which the restaurant is held, as well as the chance to receive instruction from Adriï¿½ and his chefs, explains why apprentices travel, at their own expense, from Seoul and Bologna and Los Angeles and Caracas to the tiny, overbuilt town of Roses on Spain&#x2019;s Costa Brava. It is also why they agree to work fourteen hours at a stretch in exchange for one meal a day, a bed in an unattractive apartment, and exactly no pay. It is why they stand practically still for seven of those hours, their feet planted at the center counter, squeezing the germ from thousands of kernels of corn or trimming the slime off anemones. If they make it through the six months that elBulli is open, they are able to say that they have worked in the best restaurant in the world. Luca Balboni, one of 2009&#x2019;s three Italian stagiaires, puts it like this: &#x201c;A <i>stage</i> at elBulli is like a baptism. Without it, you&#x2019;re not really a Christian.&#x201d; </p><p>Yet it wasn&#x2019;t that long ago that a <i>stage</i> in Spain would have been more like an excommunication. &#x201c;It would be like saying you were going to go train in Turkey or someplace,&#x201d; says chef Dan Barber of New York&#x2019;s Blue Hill restaurant. &#x201c;Interesting in an ethnographic way, but it would have meant you weren&#x2019;t serious about cuisine.&#x201d; Indeed, as late as the 1980s, Spanish food had almost no reputation at all; when expatriates such as Gerry Dawes and Janet Mendel began writing about it, they had to persuade skeptics that there was more to Spanish cuisine than paella and gazpacho. That Spain is now the most exciting and admired place to work for a serious student of cuisine is the result of the labor of dozens of innovative chefs and hundreds of exceptional producers. But in its origins, the phenomenon is almost entirely attributable to Ferran Adriï¿½. </p><p>The <i>stage</i> is a remnant of Europe&#x2019;s medieval guilds. In fact, it is older than restaurants themselves and in its traditional form more akin to the voluntary indenturing that a young man would undertake in order to learn to print books than anything you might see on <i>Top Chef</i>. These days, a formal apprenticeship is no longer mandatory for an ambitious chef, and the modern incarnation of the <i>stage</i> is most often an internship arranged by his culinary school&#x2014;with all the abuse-avoiding oversight and regulation that implies. Or it can be an impromptu passage: a young cook asks to spend a week or a month in the kitchen of an established restaurant, doing the drudge work&#x2014;peeling the potatoes, cleaning the snails, chopping the garlic&#x2014;in exchange for the chance to learn from a chef he admires. </p><p>But at elBulli, the <i>stage</i> remains a formal training period, with a beginning and end that coincide more or less exactly with the six months that the restaurant is open. Prospective stagiaires send in their applications a year in advance, so that a few months before the season begins, the restaurant has compiled a collection of cooks eager to indenture themselves. With only thirty-two slots to fill, the odds are against most of them. Those who do get in have Marc Cuspinera to thank. </p><p>For years, Marc was elBulli&#x2019;s chef de cuisine, but these days he oversees an odd combination of administrative and design work for the restaurant. With his longish sideburns and gently ironic sense of humor, he could be running a retro record shop in Brooklyn selling vinyl records. Instead, he is in charge of a broad category of tasks at elBulli that include scheduling photo shoots of...</p></p><h2>Sorcerer 02 Khare Of Cityports</h2><p>Khare, where every doorway and alley may conceal sudden danger - or unexpected help!

It is again narrated by Horn, who has embarked on a quest from his home on the planet Blue in search of the heroic leader Patera Silk. Now Horn's identity has become ambiguous, a complex question embedded in the story, whose telling is itself complex, shifting from place to place, present to past. Horn recalls visiting the Whorl, the enormous spacecraft in orbit that brought the settlers from Urth, and going thence to the planet Green, home of the blood-drinking alien inhumi. There, he led a band of mercenary soldiers, answered to the name of Rajan, and later became the ruler of a city state. He has also encountered the mysterious aliens, the Neighbors, who once inhabited both Blue and Green. He remembers a visit to Nessus, on Urth. At some point, he died. His personality now seemingly inhabits a different body, so that even his sons do not recognize him. And people mistake him for Silk, to whom he now bears a remarkable resemblance. <i>In Green's Jungles</i> is Wolfe's major new fiction, <i>The Book of the Short Sun</i>, building toward a strange and seductive climax.<br></p><p>Gene Wolfe has stymied and delighted smart science fiction readers for years. His complex, multilayered narratives, untrustworthy narrators, and puzzle-box characters send those of us who like that sort of thing into paroxysms of thrilling speculation, re-reading, and just plain guessing what it all means. <i>In Green's Jungles</i> is the middle book of Wolfe's opus trilogy, The Book of the Short Sun (the first is <i>On Blue's Waters</i>). It is by no means necessary to start with his other series, The Book of the New Sun and The Book of the Long Sun, in order to enjoy what is most likely the final examination of the universe Wolfe has created. But critics and fans are mostly in agreement that they are best read in order, and that the Short Sun series is the best of an astonishing bunch.<p> <i>In Green's Jungles</i> follows narrator Horn as he voyages to the planet Green (Blue's companion) and to the abandoned generational starship known as the Whorl in search of the godlike Patera Silk. As Horn recounts his adventures, his own identity becomes muddled, and we find out his interactions with the vampiric inhumi of Green and the strange alien Neighbors were deeper than we knew. In fact, Horn may not be himself at all anymore. Tantalizing story details drip slowly from Wolfe's pen:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Through the ring a Neighbor saw him, and she came to him in his agony.... she said, "I cannot make you well again, and if I could you would still be in this place. I can do this for you, however, if you desire it. I can send your spirit into someone else, into someone whose own spirit is dying."</blockquote><p> So who is Horn? Has he become Patera Silk--it seems so, for people begin mistaking him for the heroic leader. Is he the warrior king Rajan, or is he something entirely new, formed by the strange places and people around him into a savior of worlds? Identity, love, and faith weave through the themes of <i>In Green's Jungles</i>, and Wolfe has added another masterpiece to a shelf full of them. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Gene Wolfe has been called "the finest writer the science fiction world has yet produced" by <i>The Washington Post</i>.

Cathy and Chris, haunted by the tragedies and sins of the past, return at last to Foxworth Hall where they were hidden so long ago. Despite every endeavor, they find that they are prisoners of a past they cannot escape, and with a terrifying certainty, the past comes back to prey upon them once more!</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Foxworth Hall</b><br><br>And so it came to pass the summer when I was fifty-two and Chris was fifty-four that our mother's promise of riches, made long ago when I was twelve and Chris was fourteen, was at last realized.<br><br>We both stood and stared at that huge, intimidating house I'd never expected to see again. Even though it was not an exact duplicate of the original Foxworth Hall, still I quivered inside. What a price both Chris and I had paid to stand where we were now, temporary rulers over this mammoth house that should have been left in charred ruins. Once, long ago, I'd believed he and I would live in this house like a princess and prince, and between us we'd have the golden touch of King Midas, only with more control.<br><br>I no longer believed in fairy tales.<br><br>As vividly as if it had happened only yesterday, I remembered that chill summer night full of mystical moonlight and magical stars in a black velvet sky when we'd first approached this place, expecting only the best to happen. We had found only the worst.<br><br>At that time Chris and I had been so young, innocent and trusting, believing in our mother, loving her, believing as she led us and our five-year-old twin brother and sister through the dark and somehow scary night, to that huge house called Foxworth Hall, that all our future days would be colored green for wealth and yellow for happiness.<br><br>What blind faith we'd had when we tagged along behind.<br><br>Locked away in that dim and dreary upstairs room, playing in that dusty, musty attic, we'd sustained our selves by our belief in our mother's promises that someday Foxworth Hall and all its fabulous riches would be ours. However, despite all her promises, a cruel and heartless old grandfather with a bad but tenacious heart refused to stop beating in order to let four young and hopeful hearts live, and so we'd waited, and waited, until more than three long, long years passed, and Momma failed to keep her promise.<br><br>And not until the day <i>she</i> died -- and her will was read -- did Foxworth Hall fall under our control. She had left the mansion to Bart, her favorite grandson, my child by her own second husband, but until he was twenty-five, the estate was held in trust by Chris.<br><br>Foxworth Hall had been ordered reconstructed before she moved to California to find us, but it wasn't until after her death that the final touches were completed on the new Foxworth Hall.<br><br>For fifteen years the house stood empty, overseen by caretakers legally supervised by a staff of attorneys who had either written or called Chris long distance to discuss with him the problems that arose. A waiting mansion, grieving, perhaps, waiting for the day when Bart decided he'd go there to live, as we'd always presumed one day he'd do. Now he was offering this house to us for a short while, to be our own until he arrived and took over.<br><br>There was always a catch in every lure offered, whispered my ever-suspicious mind. I felt the lure now, reaching out to ensnare us again. Had Chris and I traveled such a long road only to come full circle, back to the beginning?<br><br>What would be the catch this time?<br><br>No, no, I kept telling myself, my suspicious, everdoubting nature was getting the better of me. We had the gold without the tarnish...we did! We did have to realize our just rewards some day. The night was over -- our day had finally come, and we were now standing in the full sunlight of dreams come true.<br><br>0 To actually be here, planning to live in that restored home, put sudden familiar gall in my mouth. All my pleasure vanished. I was actually realizing a nightmare that wouldn't vanish when I opened my eyes.<br><br>I threw off the feeling, smiled at Chris, squeezed his fingers and stared at the restored Foxworth Hall, risen from the ashes of the old, to confront and confound us again with its majesty, its formidable size, its sense of abiding evil, its myriad windows with their black shutters like heavy lids over stony dark eyes. It loomed high and wide, spreading over several acres in magnificent but intimidating grandeur. It was larger than most hotels, formed in the shape of a giant T, only crossed on each end to give it an enormous center section, with wings jutting off north and south, east and west.<br><br>It was constructed of rosy pink bricks. The many black shutters matched the roof of slate. Four impressive white Corinthian columns supported a gracious front portico. A sunburst of stained glass was over the black double front doors. Huge brass escutcheon plates decorated the doors and made what could have been plain rather elegant and less somber.<br><br>This might have cheered me if the sun hadn't suddenly taken a fugitive position behind a passing dark cloud. I glanced upward at a sky turned stormy and foreboding, heralding rain and wind. The trees in the surrounding forest began to sway so that birds took alarmed flight and screeched as they flew for cover. The green lawns so immaculately kept were quickly littered with broken twigs and falling leaves, and the blooming flowers in geometrically laid-out beds were lashed to the ground unmercifully.<br><br>I trembled and thought: <i>Tell me again, Christopher Doll, that it's going to work out fine. Tell me again, for I don't really believe now that the sun has gone and the storm is drawing nearer.</i><br><br>He glanced upward, too, sensing my growing anxiety, my unwillingness to go through with this, despite my promise to Bart, my second son. Seven years ago his psychiatrists had told us their treatment was successful and that Bart was quite normal and could live out his life without needing therapy on a regular basis.<br><br>To give me comfort Chris's arm lifted to encircle my shoulders. His lips lowered to brush my cheek. "It's going to work out for all of us. I know it will. We're no longer the Dresden dolls trapped in an upstairs room, dependent on our elders to do the right thing. Now we're the adults, in control of our lives. Until Bart reaches the stated age of inheritance, you and I are the owners. Dr. and Mrs. Christopher Sheffield from Marin County, California, and no one will know us as brother and sister. They won't suspect that we are truly descendants of the Foxworths. We have left all troubles behind us. Cathy, this is our chance. Here, in this house, we can undo all the harm done to us and to our children, especially Bart. We'll rule not with steel wills and iron fists, as was Malcolm's way, but with love, compassion and understanding."<br><br>Because Chris had his arm about me, holding me tight against his side, I gained strength enough to look at the house in a new light. It was beautiful. For Bart's sake we'd stay until his twenty-fifth birthday, and then Chris and I would take Cindy with us and fly to Hawaii, where we'd always wanted to live out our lives, near the sea and white beaches. Yes, that's the way it was supposed to be. The way it had to be. Smiling, I turned to Chris. "You're right. I am not afraid of this house, or any house." He chuckled and lowered his arm to my waist, pressuring me forward.<br><br>Soon after finishing high school, my first son Jory had flown to New York City to join his grandmother, Madame Marisha. There, in her ballet company, he'd soon been noticed by the critics and was given leading roles. His childhood sweetheart, Melodie, had flown east to join Jory.<br><br>At the age of twenty, my Jory had married Melodie, who was only a year younger. The pair of them had struggled and worked to reach the top. They were now the most notable ballet team in the country, a team of perfect, beautiful coordination, as if they could reach each other's mind and signal with a flash of their eyes. For five years they'd been riding the crest of success. Every performance brought rave reviews from the critics and from the public. Television exposure had given them a larger audience than they could ever have gained by personal appearances alone.<br><br>Madame Marisha had died in her sleep two years ago, though we could console ourselves by knowing she'd lived to be eighty-seven and had worked up until the very day she passed away.<br><br>Around the age of seventeen, my second son Bart had transformed almost magically from a backward student into the most brilliant one in his school. By that time Jory had flown on to New York. I had thought at the time that Jory's absence had brought Bart out of his shell and made him interested in learning. Just two days ago, he had graduated from Harvard Law School, the valedictorian of his class.<br><br>Chris and I had joined Melodie and Jory in Boston, and in the huge auditorium of Harvard Law School we'd watched Bart receive his law degree. Only Cindy, our adopted daughter, was not there. She was at her best friend's house in South Carolina. It had given me new pain to know that Bart could not let go of his envy of a girl who'd done her best to win his approval -- especially when he'd done nothing to win hers. It gave me additional pain to know that Cindy couldn't let go of her dislike of Bart long enough to help him celebrate.<br><br>"No!" she'd shouted over the telephone, "I don't care if he did send me an invitation! It's just his way of showing off. He can put ten degrees behind his name and I still won't admire or like him -- not after all he did to me. Explain to Jory and Melodie why, so their feelings won't be hurt. But you won't have to explain to Bart. He'll know."<br><br>I'd sat between Chris and Jory and stared, amazed that a son who was so reticent at home, so moody and unwilling to communicate, could rise to the top of his class and be named valedictorian. His impassioned words created a mesmerizing spell. I glanced at Chris, who looked proud enough to burst before he grinned at me.<br><br>"Wow, who would have guessed? He's terrific, Cathy. Aren't you proud? I know I am."<br><br>Yes, yes, of course, I was very proud to see Bart up there. Still, I knew the Bart behind the podium was not the Bart we all knew at home. Maybe he was safe now. Completely normal -- his doctors had said so.<br><br>To my way of thinking, there were many small indications that Bart had not changed as dramatically as his doctors thought. He'd said just before we parted, "You must be there, Mother, when I come into my own." Not a word about Chris being there with me. "It's important to me that <i>you</i> be there."<br><br>Always he had to force himself to speak Chris's name. "We'll invite Jory and his wife down, too, and, of course, Cindy." He'd grimaced just to say her name. It was beyond me how anyone could dislike a girl as pretty and sweet as our beloved adopted daughter. I couldn't have loved Cindy more if she'd been flesh of my flesh, and blood of my Christopher Doll. In a way, since she'd come to us at the age of two, she was our child, the only one we could claim as truly belonging to both of us.<br><br>Cindy was sixteen now, and much more voluptuous than I'd been at her age. But Cindy hadn't been as deprived as I. Her vitamins had come from fresh air and sunshine, both of which had been denied four imprisoned children. Good food and exercise...she'd had the best. We'd had the worst.<br><br>Chris asked if we were going to stay out here all day and wait for pelting rain to drench us both before we went inside. He tugged me forward, urging me on with his cheerful confidence.<br><br>Gradually, step by slow step, as the thunder began to crash and swiftly come closer, with the swollen, heavy sky zigzagging with frightening electrical bolts, we approached the grand portico of Foxworth Hall. <br><br>I began to notice details I'd missed before. The portico floor was made of mosaic tiles in three shades of red intricately laid to form a sunburst pattern that matched the glass sunburst over the double front doors. I looked at those sunburst windows and rejoiced. They hadn't been here before. Perhaps it was just as Chris had predicted. It wouldn't be the same, just as no two snowflakes were the same.<br><br>Then I was frowning, for to all intents and purposes, who ever saw the differences in falling snowflakes?<br><br>"Stop looking for something to steal the pleasure from this day, Catherine. I see it on your face, in your eyes. I vow on my word of honor that we will leave this house as soon as Bart has his party and fly on to Hawaii. If a hurricane comes and blows a tidal wave over our home once we're there, it will be because you expect that to happen."<br><br>He made me laugh. "Don't forget the volcano," I said with a small giggle. "It could hurl hot lava at us." He grinned and playfully spanked my bottom.<br><br>"Quit! Please, please. August tenth will see us on our plane -- but a hundred to one you'll worry about Jory, about Bart, and wonder what he's doing all alone in this house."<br><br>That's when I remembered something forgotten until now. Waiting inside Foxworth Hall was the surprise Bart had promised would be there. How strangely he'd looked when he'd said that.<br><br>"Mother, it will blow your mind when you see -- " He'd paused, smiled and looked uneasy. "I've flown down there each summer just to check things over and see that the house wasn't being neglected and left to mold and decay. I gave orders to interior decorators to make it look exactly as it used to, except for my office. I want that modern, with all the electronic conveniences I'll need. But...if you want, you can do a few things to make it cozy."<br><br>Cozy? How could a house such as this ever be cozy? I knew what it felt like to be enclosed inside, swallowed, trapped forever. I shivered as I heard the click of my high heels beside the dull thuds of Chris's shoes as we neared the black doors with their escutcheons made decorative with heraldic shields. I wondered if Bart had looked up the Foxworth ancestry and found the titles of aristocracy and the coats of arms he desperately wanted and seemed to need.

Evans), Ian Kershaw's <em>Hitler</em> is a new, distilled, one-volume masterpiece that will become the standard work. From Hitler's origins as a failed artist in fin-de-siecle Vienna to the terrifying last days in his Berlin bunker, Kershaw's richly illustrated biography is a mesmerizing portrait of how Hitler attained, exercised, and retained power. Drawing on previously untapped sources, such as Goebbels's diaries, Kershaw addresses crucial questions about the unique nature of Nazi radicalism, about the Holocaust, and about the poisoned European world that allowed Hitler to operate so effectively.<br> 151 photographs; 8 maps</p><p><p>Front Flap<br>&nbsp;In this now classic account, Ian Kershaw takes an innovative approach to the Hitler story. By putting forward the idea of Hitler as a 'charismatic leader'&nbsp;Kershaw tries to find answers to the questions of why Hitler of all the nationalist-racist fanatics with roughly similar views in Germany after the First World War should find such appeal, how such an unlikely figure as Hitler could come to wield such extraordinary personalised power, what his personal role in the shaping of policy amounted to, and whether he was indeed personally directing policy and taking the key decisions down to the very end.&nbsp;Hitler is portayed by Kershaw as a social product, not a demonic figure. He is depicted as the product of a society at a particular conjuncture - a society gripped by an extraordinary and comprehensive crisis of values, an overwhelming cultural as well as political, social and economic crisis. In the fourteen years that follwed the end of the First World War, he gradually emerged as the mouthpiece of the nationalist masses and&nbsp;eventually transformed himself into what over thirteen million Germans saw as the hope of national salvation.&nbsp;Ian Kershaw&nbsp;offers original insights into&nbsp;how Hitler 'became possible' and paints a compelling portrait of dictatorial power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Back Flap<br><br><b>Ian Kershaw</b> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield.

From a heart-shaped mangrove forest in New Caledonia to a flock of red ibises in Venezuela, from a caravan of camels in Mauritania to Mt. Everest and Mammoth Hot Springs, renowned aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand presents striking color images that put our home planet in a whole new perspective. Produced under the sponsorship of UNESCO, the book is also a documentary record of the state of the world's fragile environment.<br><br>This vibrant new edition of the internationally acclaimed original features an updated design and nearly 60 stunning new photographs. All new captions and the addition of authoritative new texts by experts in various environmental fields illuminate Arthus-Bertand's monumental achievement.</p><p>Ecology, a science scarcely a century old, aims to give its practitioners an approach to understanding how whole natural systems--for example, watersheds, deserts, and estuaries--work. Few books translate this aim as well as <i>Earth from Above</i>, a stunning collection of photographs that affords its viewers a window into the world's workings. It is something of a commonplace, for instance, that the large-scale logging now being visited on the world's rainforests is causing untold damage to tropical ecosystems. In French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand's hands, this problem is translated from arid fact to alarming image, giving immediate meaning to the statistics that underlie today's environmental headlines; his photographs of the ruins of rural Madagascar, where forests are being cleared at a rate of 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles) annually, are a sad case in point.<p> Arthus-Bertrand, working with the support of UNESCO, has wandered the globe to gather this collection of more than 200 photographs, presented in a folio format. The images are uniformly striking, whether of stalagmite-like fans of algae spreading into the Mediterranean Sea, farmers working their fields in northern India, or destroyed Iraqi tanks littering the deserts of Kuwait. The accompanying text, captions, and short essays by some of France's leading scientists and social critics lend specific depth to the images, which will cheer few readers--but that will shock, and educate, and, with luck, inspire closer attention to the world around us. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Yann Arthus-Bertrand has been portraying the state of the planet in photographs since 1995.

Wide awake long past his bedtime, a young boy slips outside his house to join some special friends in a nighttime jubilation. Complete with howls and whoops, they joyously celebrate the mystery and magic of the night, basking in the glow of the moonlight. They howled at the moon, they howled at life, and they howled with all things in the night. But their revelry comes to a halt when the moon is caught in the branches of a tree.

The overall mood is one of whimsy and wonder as a small boy in star-embellished pajamas, accompanied by a bevy of small companions (dog, owl, flower, rabbit, toad, and chicken), sashays outside for a nighttime romp. When the moon gets itself caught in the branches of an apple tree, no one but the boy is brave enough, or tree-climbing-capable enough, to help out. Still, he is unable to budge the moon. But then the child has an ingenious idea, &#x201c;a delicious thought, a bright, ripe, red thought.&#x201d; He feeds the moon the tree&#x2019;s fruit until the moon grows big, fat and round, and can be rolled free.

It&#x2019;s so easy, in fact, that, for thousands of years, wine-makers have been trying to develop ways to prevent wine from automatically fermenting into vinegar. Don&#x2019;t think of this text simply as a how-to manual for making top-shelf vinegar or vinegar-based recipes. Consider it your guide to unlocking the potential of every sweet, salty, sour, and savory bit in your food. Believe it or not, acidic and sour foods like vinegar have the ability to open our senses and make our taste buds more sensitive to all the other tastes. At the same time, they also work to bring balance as well as tone down the intensity of overtly bitter and fatty foods.<br><br>As a species, we are hardwired to taste sour foods. Some biologists feel that we evolved this ability in order to know if high-energy foods such as fruit were ripe. Unripe fruits don&#x2019;t have the fully developed sugars we need to consume for instant energy. If we can taste their sourness, then we know to wait a little longer before eating them. On the other hand, there are some biologists who believe we developed this ability to warn us of potentially hazardous foods. Some spoiled foods can accumulate organic acids, and some really acidic foods can actually physically harm us. I&#x2019;ll leave it to the scientists to figure out the reason for our ability to taste sour foods, but with either of these concepts, sour takes on a &#x201c;forbidden fruit&#x201d; quality.<br><br>My working understanding of sour taste is from years of eating and cooking. I remember when my kids were little and just starting to eat solid food. Amelia and I would give them slices of lemon to gnaw on. With each bite, they would pull back from the lemon and intensely pucker their faces. What looked like displeasure would instantly fade into a smile followed by another bite. This got me thinking about how we look to sour foods as a source of pleasure and enjoyment while eating. I mean, what kid doesn&#x2019;t stuff their mouth repeatedly with Sour Patch Kids on a regular basis?<br><br>We simply crave sour foods. This is evident in cuisines around the globe. From the Pennsylvania Dutch to the people of Shanxi Province in northern China, sour foods are an instrumental&#x2014;actually fundamental&#x2014;part of how we enjoy what we cook and eat. Why else would a fatty grilled sausage virtually beg to be slathered in a boldly tart brown mustard? Sour ingredients just have a natural way of making us happy. As a chef, it&#x2019;s important to be able to craft and manipulate foods in ways that appease the diner. Vinegar makes this possible to do, to create balance in any dish. It&#x2019;s so important that it has literally become the cornerstone of all my cooking.<br><br>With all of that being said, let&#x2019;s thank whoever produced that crappy bottle of vinegar I bought many moons ago. It was the best twenty-nine dollars I ever pissed down the drain.</p><h2>Lavender: The Grower&#39;s Guide</h2><p>With their heady perfume and stunning visual appeal, lavenders have been prized by gardeners since ancient times. <i>Lavender</i> is a truly comprehensive study that enables the reader to research and identify more than 200 lavender species and varieties.

From the market square to the mud-and-stone houses of the poor, to the new buildings of the Spanish, all of Cuzco was filled with color and perfume, and the promise of the ripening year.<br>Don Ezequias Pannefrio y Modestez tore his eyes away from the fragrant display on his balcony and gave his attention to his visitor. His servant, pausing to listen in the doorway, attracted no real attention from either man. &#x201c;Yes, Conde, what may I do to be of service?&#x201d; He was a mature man, of imposing stature and impeccable manners, with regular features, clever golden-brown eyes and an unexpected, quirky smile that turned his thin-lipped mouth from severe to wry in an instant; his hair was streaked with silver and cut somewhat shorter than current fashion so that it only brushed his soft, wide collar. Seated be-hind his writing table, he was not quite so impressive as when he was standing, but the breadth of his shoulder was still remarkable.<br>Francisco Ragoczy, el Conde de San Germanno, bowed slightly to the regional magistrate and said, &#x201c;I regret I must impose upon the introduction of your cousin once again, but I fear it is necessary, Presi-dencia. I have been told I must apply to you for permission to employ natives as servants. I believe the license is called an encomienda, though I do not wish to be allotted any territory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As a foreigner, you would need the permission of the Corregidor in any case. For employing servants in the household, I have the authority to grant the encomienda.&#x201d; Don Ezequias hinted a bow.<br>&#x201c;That is my understanding. Therefore, behold me and my petition.&#x201d; His quick, ironic look belied the formality of his words. Like Don Ezequias, he wore black, but unlike Don Ezequias, it suited him, as did the Italian cut of his clothes and the ruby fixed in his white silk lace-edged collar bands. A pectoral in the form of a winged disk depended from the ruby-studded silver chain around his neck.<br>&#x201c;Ah, yes,&#x201d; said Don Ezequias. &#x201c;Of course. I had not realized you would want to do that, or I should have issued the license before now. Your house must be almost ready to receive visitors, and servants are always required to serve one&#x2019;s guests.&#x201d; He drew a sheet of vellum toward him, then selected one of the sharpened quills and dipped it into his standish; the fragile plume seemed too small for his large hand, as did the moderate ruffles at his wrist. &#x201c;These servants&#x2014;how many do you think you will need?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Eight at first. To establish the household. If more are necessary, I will ask for them when the need arises, if that is acceptable to you,&#x201d; said San Germanno, his left hand resting comfortably on the hilt of his sword in the same manner as most of the Spaniards affected.<br>&#x201c;Suppose I authorize ten?&#x201d; offered Don Ezequias. &#x201c;That should be sufficient to your needs, Conde, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are very understanding,&#x201d; said San Germanno. He watched while Don Ezequias completed the brief document and sanded the ink. &#x201c;If there is some appropriate way I might show my thanks for this?&#x201d;<br>Don Ezequias was about to say no, but then his expression changed. &#x201c;Yes. I think there may be something you can do for me.&#x201d; He tapped his big hand twice at the edge of the page. &#x201c;I will be giving a reception for the Incan nobility in ten days&#x2019; time. If you would be available to attend, I would appreciate it if you would be willing to escort the daughter of Quispe Titu. Her name is Acanna Tupac, she is a woman past youth but of some importance, and most of her relatives prefer not to recognize her. In spite of this, she must be included because of her birth. It would be less of an ordeal for all of us if you would do this for me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Certainly,&#x201d; said San Germanno at once, inwardly glad for the opportunity he was being presented; then he added, &#x201c;I would consider it an honor to perform that office. But it might be easier for all of us if I knew the reason she is shunned by her kinsmen.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ah, that is something of a difficult matter,&#x201d; said Don Ezequias, fingering the point of his small beard. &#x201c;But I suppose it would be best to tell you.&#x201d; He leaned back in his chair and again let his gaze wander to the profusion of flowers on his balcony. &#x201c;It is a question of family lines. She is the last of the senior branch of the royal family. We promoted the cadet branch; they were more willing to assist us than the senior was.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hardly surprising that they would,&#x201d; said San Germanno, recalling many other times when this ploy had succeeded where force of arms would not.<br>&#x201c;I agree,&#x201d; said Don Ezequias, his attention still on the flowers. &#x201c;Still, the woman must have a suitable escort and I would be grateful if you would do this for me. It would spare me the necessity of asking one of the Dominicans to do it, and I would rather not. Acanna Tupac would be offended.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So might the Dominician,&#x201d; San Germanno remarked, and repeated with an emotion which Don Ezequias could not read, &#x201c;I would be honored.&#x201d; He paused a moment, then went on. &#x201c;Tell me more of this Acanna Tupac. Do I have her name right? If I am to be in her company, I should know more about her, so that I will not commit any gaffe while with her, or give offense to your guests.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have her name right, Conde.&#x201d; The Presidencia shrugged and began to prepare wax for his official seal on the encomienda. &#x201c;I actually know very little about her, aside from her being the great-granddaughter of Quispe Tupac and the great-great granddaughter of Atahualpa Inca and his third wife Choque Suyo. Juan Enrique de Almansa Inca y Loyola explained the genealogy to me shortly after I arrived; such things are as important to these Incas as they are to Spaniards. I have met her only twice before. She keeps to her own society, in part because she has little money, and in part because the clergy have not been kind to her. She is probably nearer forty than thirty, unmarried, though whether she is a spinster or a widow, I cannot discover.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What company does she bring with her?&#x201d; asked San Germanno. &#x201c;Someone of so high a birth surely does not come alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Occasionally she brings another woman with her, but most often her only suite is her servants, and she does not have many of them.&#x201d; He dropped a blob of hot wax onto the foot of the vellum sheet, then turned his ring to fix its impression in it.<br>&#x201c;I take it she is not well-connected, then; I would have thought with such relations she would have been better provided for. Is there not an inheritance to support her?&#x201d; There was no criticism in this observation; San Germanno waited for Don Ezequias&#x2019; answer with interest.<br>&#x201c;No. She has nothing. None of the senior line have much left. My predecessors saw to that.&#x201d; This last was admitted grimly. &#x201c;It was a successful ploy, and it suited their purposes perfectly, keeping the senior branch in obscurity while raising the cadet branch to prominence for their own uses.&#x201d; He stared at his fingers. &#x201c;She is...striking, not beautiful, and most dignified.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And such treatment rankles with you, does it not? the elevation of the cadet branch as a way to control the senior branch by removing the privileges of the senior line,&#x201d; said San Germanno, recalling the many times he had seen cadet relatives supplant their seniors. &#x201c;You believe it is an unworthy way to gain control of the country.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I did not say so,&#x201d; Don Ezequias responded promptly.<br>&#x201c;No, you did not, but your implication was fairly clear; for what comfort it will bring you, I share your indignation,&#x201d; San Germanno told him, and waited.<br>Don Ezequias answered carefully. &#x201c;If I were indignant, I would be most unwise to admit it. And so would you. Indignation on behalf of these people will benefit neither you nor them. Obispo Punto y Sello is inclined to think such opinions are heresy, and though he may be in Lima, his power reaches from the southern tip of Audiencia de Charcas to the northern-most edge of Audiencia de Nueva Galicia. All other Obispos are afraid of him. And no one&#x2014;not clergy, not officials&#x2014;is promoted without his approval.&#x201d; He inspected the impression of his seal and nodded twice before handing the license to San Germanno. &#x201c;There, Conde: permission to employ up to ten natives in your household. No one will question it. If you have any interference from...anyone, show them this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said San Germanno, taking the vellum and rolling it with care. &#x201c;You have made my situation much less awkward with this single sheet.&#x201d; He bowed again, this time formally.<br>&#x201c;It pleases me to have men of your calibre here in Cuzco, where one cannot be too selective if one wishes any friends at all. You improve the society more than you know. If we had more like you, and fewer of those who seek&#x2014;&#x201d; Don Ezequias broke off, noticing the ironic lift of San Germanno&#x2019;s fine brows. He cleaned the point of his quill on a small square of cotton and put it back in the stand. After a moment he added, &#x201c;Too often those who come here are those who are not welcome in Europe, or those greedy for what they cannot have in the Old World. We are where all the misfits are sent. All of them. Only a few, like yourself, are here from choice that is not the product of zeal or greed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So I have gathered,&#x201d; said San Germanno, his tone level; this was not a matter he wanted to discuss, for it could be used to his detriment if Don Ezequias reported his opi...</p><h2>You Can&#39;t Win</h2><p>An amazing autobiography of a criminal from a forgotten time in american history.

Homer, it is claimed here, was a poet from Holland who lived in Spain and France. Maps, photos, tables and comparisons of place names, tides, vegetation, etc., support a flimsy argument.

Ara Pacis: The Pax Romana is the theme of this ancient monument on the banks of the Tiber. Reconstructed in the 1930s from remnants scattered across scores of museums, the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace) was commissioned by the Roman senate as a tribute to Emperor Augustus and the peace that followed his imperial expansion. The rectangular structure is now enclosed within a museum designed by American architect Richard Meier and opened in 2006. The monument is covered in intricate carvings, including renderings of Augustus and his family, a scene that may have represented the dedication of the Ara Pacis in 13 b.c. Across the street is the crumbling Mausoleum of Augustus, no longer open to visitors and badly in need of restoration.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Piazza di Spagna: Named after the Spanish Embassy that once overlooked the square, the Piazza di Spagna has been the coolest place to hang out in Rome for nearly 300 years. The neighborhood has long attracted foreigners&#x2014;Lord Byron, Keats, Shelley, Goethe, Ibsen, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, and Hans Christian Andersen are among the artistic hipsters who frequented the local inns and cafï¿½s. The Spanish Steps were added in the 1720s to connect the square with Santissima Trinitï¿½ dei Monti, the Renaissance church on the hilltop above. La Barcaccia, the boat-shaped fountain at the base of the Spanish Steps, predates the stairway by a hundred years. The area&#x2019;s chic boutiques are a recent addition.<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. Keats&#x2013;Shelley House: Perched on the south side of the Spanish Steps, the building is a holy grail of the early 19th-century English Romantic movement. Poet John Keats moved here in 1820 and died, aged 25, from tuberculosis the following year. Percy Bysshe Shelley lived nearby. He perished in 1822 when he drowned off the Italian coast. Memories of them linger on, as do those of the other Romantics that round out the collection of this marvelous small museum. Exhibits include Keats&#x2019;s death mask and an original manuscript by Mary Shelley, wife of the poet and author of Frankenstein.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Piazza del Popolo: Once the spot where religious heretics were executed, the Piazza del Popolo is now the &#x201c;people&#x2019;s square&#x201d; and a venue for mass political gatherings. From here a Roman road called the Via Flaminia began its journey north up the Italian Peninsula. On the square&#x2019;s southern side, baroque twin churches&#x2014;Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in Montesanto&#x2014;flank the Via del Corso. The whitewashed Porta del Popolo on the northern side was Rome&#x2019;s primary gateway through much of the Middle Ages and beyond. Architect Giuseppe Valadier conceived the current square in the early 19th century, including ramps and steps that ascend the Pincio hill and an Egyptian obelisk that once graced the Circo Massimo.<br> &nbsp;<br> 5. Santa Maria del Popolo: Raphael, Caravaggio, and Bramante were among the Italian masters who contributed to this lavish church on the north side of the Piazza del Popolo. According to legend, the original church on the site was created to vanquish the ghost of the long-dead Roman emperor Nero, who was buried nearby. It was replaced by the current Renaissance structure, commissioned in 1472 by Pope Sixtus IV della Rovere. Among several frescoes by Pinturicchio, don&#x2019;t miss a delightful &#x201c;Adoration of the Christ Child&#x201d; above the altar in the Della Rovere Chapel. Raphael designed the ornate Chigi Chapel for the wealthy banker Agostino Chigi. A pair of Caravaggio masterpieces&#x2014;&#x201c;The Conversion of St. Paul on the Road to Damascus&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Crucifixion of St. Peter&#x201d;&#x2014;hang in the Cerasi Chapel.<br> &nbsp;<br> 6. The Pincio: The lofty green space above the Piazza del Popolo is the Pincio garden, the western sector of the extensive Villa Borghese gardens, but in many respects its own little world replete with busts of notable Italians, an unusual water clock, and the San Carlino marionette theater. The symmetry between square and garden is not accidental: Giuseppe Valadier designed both during the French occupation of Rome under Napoleon. The Piazza Napoleone is an excellent perch to view the Popolo neighborhood directly below and St. Peter&#x2019;s in the distance.<br> &nbsp;<br> 7. Villa Giulia: Built as a country palace for Pope Julius III in the 1550s, the ornate Renaissance villa now houses the Museo Nazionale Etrusco, Italy&#x2019;s premier showcase of regional art and artifacts predating the Roman Empire. Among its many treasures are the Etruscan Sarcofago degli Sposi (Sarcophagus of the Spouses), an incredibly lifelike terra-cotta rendering of a married couple reclining on a banquet sofa, from the sixth century b.c. Set in the northwest corner of the Villa Borghese, the building reflects the extravagant lifestyle of Renaissance popes, in particular a two-story nymphaeum (water grotto) in the garden where Julius entertained guests in summer.<br> &nbsp;<br> 8. Villa Borghese: Cardinal Scipione Borghese, who created the villa and its surrounding gardens, amassed a substantial fortune in the early 17th century via family connections and a devious nature that would have put Machiavelli to shame. The villa now houses the Galleria Borghese, while the gardens have become Rome&#x2019;s most popular park. Stroll along gravel pathways shaded by umbrella pines&#x2014;perfect on a hot day&#x2014;and admire statues and classical-style ornamental temples. At the center is the Giardino del Lago (Garden of the Lake), with its boating lake. Don&#x2019;t miss the delightful art nouveau Fontana dei Fauni (Fountain of the Fauns). At the north end of the park, the Galleria Nazionale d&#x2019;Arte Moderna has a good display of 19th- and 20th-century art.<br> &nbsp;<br> 9. Galleria Borghese: The Villa Borghese, housing the Galleria Borghese, originated as a temple to pleasure, a place to show off the art that belonged to Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1577&#x2013;1633), a nephew of Pope Paul V. He would bring guests through the landscaped gardens and wow them with lavish banquets, entertainments, and his stunning collection. Although Napoleon later carried off many of the prized ancient sculptures to the Louvre in Paris, the core Renaissance collection and the baroque pieces that Scipione commissioned for the villa are still in place.</p><h2>A Victor, Not a Butcher: Ulysses S. Grant&#39;s Overlooked Military Genius</h2><p>Reassessing Ulysses S. Grant&#39;s role as military leader, the author re-evaluates the general&#39;s reputation as a &#34;butcher&#34; and reveals Grant&#39;s true legacy as the military leader with the lowest casualty rates in the war--a record he maintained while still winning every battle.</p><p>Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant has been unfairly maligned because of the bloody 1864 campaigns he conducted against Robert E. Lee to secure final victory for the Union. Victor, Not A Butcher takes you into those decisive campaigns to prove that far from being a crude butcher (as he has been characterized not only by Southern partisans, but by historians) Grant's casualty rates actually compared favorably with those of other Civil War generals. Grant was an inspired military leader with a genius for issuing lucid orders, maneuvering his troops adroitly, and making excellent use of his staff. His perseverance, decisiveness, moral courage, and political acumen place him among the greatest generals of the Civil War-indeed, of all military history. <p>Author Ed Bonekemper traces Grant's record of unparalleled success-Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Iuka, Corinth, Raymond, Jackson, Champion's Hill, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, the Overland Campaign, the James River crossing, Five Forks, Petersburg, and Appomattox-showing how Grant won his victories through expert execution of carefully planned military strategies, not the meat-grinder tactics of myth. </p><p>This book also explores the paradoxes of Grant's early life, discussing how he was reluctant to attend West Point and never distinguished himself among his contemporaries there. Bonekemper also deals forthrightly with Grant's struggles in civilian life-and particularly the allegations of alcoholism and other factors that led his contemporaries (as well as historians of later generations) to underestimate him. </p><p>Bonekemper identifies the key elements of Grant's success as a general. He even demonstrates that as a military strategist and leader, Grant outshone his much-lionized rival, Robert E. Lee. He examines casualty records that prove that Grant lost fewer men in his successful effort to take Richmond and end the war than his predecessors lost in making the same attempt and failing. Bonekemper proves that it was no historical accident that Grant accepted the surrender of three entire Confederate armies-at Fort Donelson in 1862, Vicksburg in 1863, and Appomattox Court House in 1865. (No other general on either side accepted the surrender of even one army until Sherman accepted the capitulation of the remnants of the Army of Tennessee at the war's end, in mid-April 1865.) His tactics are studied carefully by American military personnel to this day. </p><p>Ulysses Grant won the Civil War. He was responsible for virtually all major Union victories in the West, the "Middle," and the East. Bonekemper ably silences Grant's critics and restores Grant to the heroic reputation he so richly deserves.</p><i>praise for Bonekemper&#x2019;s</i><br><b>ULYSSES S.

He lives in Belle Mead, New Jersey. <i>Devil's Night</i> is his third novel.1 A.M. <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Kat was dreaming about Henry when she heard the sirens. She had no idea why. It&#x2019;s not as if she dwelled on him so much during her waking hours that it invaded her subconscious at night. In fact, it had been weeks since she thought about Henry, months since she had heard from him, and a full year since she last saw him. <br>Yet there he was, front and center in her dream. They were in a nondescript room so dim and vast that Kat wasn&#x2019;t sure if it was a room at all. Dreams were like that. Ceilings not supported by walls. Floors as malleable as wet sand. The only thing concrete about their surroundings was the table in front of them&#x2014;white Formica as bright as a smile in a toothpaste commercial. <br>On the table were two large sheets of paper, thin and translucent. Henry, staring at his swath of paper, frowned. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to do this.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy,&#x201d; Kat said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; <br>She lifted a corner of her sheet to the center, cementing the fold with a crease. Henry followed suit. They did it again, this time simultaneously, with an upper fold. <br>&#x201c;See,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I told you it was easy.&#x201d; <br>Then the sirens started, so distant and muffled that Kat at first thought they were just another part of the dream. But they continued, even after Henry, the table, and the paper all vanished. That&#x2019;s when she knew they were real. <br>Kat listened without opening her eyes. Although they were far away, she could tell the sirens belonged to the fire department and not her police force. The ones on the fire trucks were louder and deeper&#x2014;the baritones to her patrol cars&#x2019; tenor. <br>Sliding out of bed, she went to the window and saw the reason for the sirens&#x2014;a fire, glowing orange and eerie in the distance. She couldn&#x2019;t tell how large it was or pinpoint its exact location. All she knew was that she needed to be there, no matter how much she wanted to crawl back into bed. Pausing only long enough to yawn, she started to put on her uniform a mere hour and a half after taking it off. <br>She was mostly dressed by the time her phone rang. As expected, it was Carl Bauersox, her deputy, sounding much more energetic than she did. On the night shift, he was used to being alert at this hour. Kat was not. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a fire, Chief.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Kat said. &#x201c;I hear the sirens. What&#x2019;s burning?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The museum.&#x201d; <br>He was referring to the Perry Hollow Historical Society and Exhibition Hall, a collection of documents, artifacts, and photographs that dated back to the town&#x2019;s founding and beyond. Because of its unwieldy name, and because most of the town&#x2019;s history resided within its walls, people simply called it the museum. <br>&#x201c;Is it bad?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Looks like it,&#x201d; Carl said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big draw, too. We&#x2019;re going to have a crowd control problem on our hands in a minute.&#x201d; <br>This didn&#x2019;t surprise Kat. Fires weren&#x2019;t common in Perry Hollow, and she was sure a good portion of the town would come out to gawk. They certainly couldn&#x2019;t sleep. Not with all those sirens echoing down the streets. <br>&#x201c;Hold them off as best you can. I&#x2019;ll be there soon.&#x201d; <br>When she was finally on the road, her own sirens blaring, Kat noticed that the fire was visible from all over town. Even from six blocks away, she could see the licks of flame flashing over the rooftops of neighboring buildings. A thick column of black smoke, rising straight up into the night sky, punctuated the blaze like an exclamation point. <br>Crossing Main Street, she noticed plenty of residents staggering along the sidewalk in tossed-on sweatpants, sneakers, and robes. All of them were headed in the same direction she was, drawn mothlike to the flames. Crowd control problem, indeed. <br>She brought her Crown Vic to a stop a block away from the museum, parking sideways in the middle of the street. It wasn&#x2019;t much of a roadblock, but it would be enough to keep any cars from trying to come through. Plus, it was easy to move out of the way to let in fire trucks from neighboring towns, if it came to that. <br>Kat hoped it wouldn&#x2019;t. <br>Leaving her patrol car, she hurried down the street, finally getting a good look at the blaze. It wasn&#x2019;t as big as she first thought, but still bad by Perry Hollow standards. It looked to be contained to the front of the building, a three-story Queen Anne with all the frilly trimmings. Fire ate away at the steeply pitched roof and munched swiftly toward the ornate turret in its center. Flames leaped from the front windows and curled in the crisp autumn air, making Kat think of Satan&#x2019;s fingers beckoning a group of sinners to Hell. <br>Filling the street in front of the museum were two of the Perry Hollow Fire Department&#x2019;s three fire trucks. A ladder truck and a standard pumper, they formed a wide V on the lawn. In the center, members of the volunteer squad&#x2014;all five of them&#x2014;had already unfurled their hoses and were now blasting away at the blaze. The jets of water rose high into the air, arching over the front lawn before diving into the flames. <br>The squad&#x2019;s third truck, trusty Engine 13, was a 1973 Ford used for brush fires. Despite its age, it was the truck that saw the most action. Brush fires were the norm in Perry Hollow. House fires were not&#x2014;a fact made noticeable by the sheer amount of onlookers standing on the other side of the street. While Kat had overestimated the force of the blaze, she had underestimated the size of the crowd. Half the town, it seemed, was there, huddling together and gazing at the flames. <br>Carl tried his best to keep them at bay, but they were an unruly lot. The young men and teenage boys in the crowd were especially eager to get closer to the fire. Kat intercepted two boys, the same age as her son, who had slipped past Carl and made it halfway across the street. <br>&#x201c;Where you headed, boys?&#x201d; <br>One of them&#x2014;a freckle-faced kid with a snide smile&#x2014;answered. &#x201c;To see if the firemen need our help.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t need anything but for you two to keep at a safe distance.&#x201d; <br>Kat ushered them back to the curb, yelling to get the attention of the rest of the crowd. &#x201c;Everyone take a step back and stay there. This isn&#x2019;t a basketball game, people. Courtside seats are not available.&#x201d; <br>She sidled up to Carl, who was visibly relieved to have reinforcements. <br>&#x201c;Just in time,&#x201d; he said, wiping sweat from his perpetually clean-shaven face. &#x201c;They were starting to overrun me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re just excited. There hasn&#x2019;t been a fire in town since&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>She cut herself off. Not that it mattered. Carl knew what she was going to say anyway. The last major fire in Perry Hollow was at the sawmill the town had been built around. Abandoned for more than a decade, it had gone up in flames a year earlier, with Kat and two others still inside. One of them had been Henry Goll, the unexpected costar of her dream. He and Kat almost died in the blaze. The person with them perished, although that wasn&#x2019;t such a bad thing, considering that he had been trying to kill them. <br>Feeling the heat of the current fire on the back of her neck, Kat realized that it was the one-year anniversary of the mill blaze. No wonder Henry had been in her dream. Her brain was trying to remind her that it was now October 31. Exactly a full year since the great Halloween fire that destroyed a piece of Perry Hollow history. <br>Kat faced the burning museum. Although she hadn&#x2019;t been inside it since grade school, seeing yet another part of the town&#x2019;s past go up in flames saddened her. At least she wasn&#x2019;t trapped inside this time. If there was a silver lining to be found, that would be it. <br>Another bright spot was the fact that the blaze already seemed to be under control. The fire on the roof had receded, leaving the museum&#x2019;s grand turret untouched. The flames at the windows, those devilish fingers, had retreated indoors, allowing the firefighters to march closer and focus on the hot spots. <br>But as the fire got smaller, the crowd on the other side of the street grew larger. There must have been fifty people there, with still more on the way. They stood in a tight pack, eyes on the fire, murmuring to each other with a combination of concern and excitement that always seemed to occur at scenes of public chaos. Kat spotted a lot of familiar faces in the crowd and nodded or waved. She saw Burt Hammond, Perry Hollow&#x2019;s mayor, sporting a black suit and a face so pale it made him resemble a wax statue. Standing with him was Father Ron, who had been the priest at All Saints Parish for as long as Kat could remember. Nearby were Jasper Foxx and Adrienne Wellington, both of whom owned stores on nearby Main Street. Dave Freeman, whose lawn bore the brunt of the onlookers, passed out Styrofoam cups to the crowd. His wife, Betty, followed, filling the cups with coffee she poured from a thermos. <br>Pushing past them was a tiny woman with a big perm, a parka thrown over her pink nightgown. Kat recognized the parka&#x2014;not to mention the hair&#x2014;as belonging to Emma Pulsifer, vice president of the Perry Hollow Historical Society. Seeing Kat, Emma rushed forward with a manic energy that verged on hysteria. <br>&#x201c;Chief Campbell, have you seen Connie?&#x201d; <br>Kat knew of at least four Connies who lived in town. &#x201c;Could you be more specific?&#x201d; <br>Emma sighed with impatience. &#x201c;Connie Bishop.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Constance?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Emma huffed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been looking for her everywhere.&#x201d; <br>Constance Bishop, a prim but eminently friendly woman, knew everything there was to know about Perry Hollow. Accordingly, she served as president of the historical society. Kat wasn&#x2019;t sure what that entailed, but she assumed the museum fire was something that would concern her. <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen her,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Have you tried calling her?&#x201d; <br>Emma held up her cell phone. &#x201c;Four times. No answer.&#x201d; <br>She looked up and down the block, head bobbing wildly. With her puffy hair and unfortunately pointy nose, she brought to mind an exotic bird, like something from South America you&#x2019;d see on the Discovery Channel. The resemblance was only heightened by the way she flapped her arms helplessly. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do. I thought Connie would be here and have a game plan.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Saving the artifacts, of course,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;There are priceless items in that building. We can&#x2019;t just watch them burn.&#x201d; <br>Kat told her they didn&#x2019;t have much choice in the matter. As long as there were still flames inside the museum, no one but members of the fire department would be going inside. That didn&#x2019;t sit well with Vice President Pulsifer. <br>&#x201c;But the deed for the land Perry Mill was built on is in there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Signed in 1760 by Irwin Perry himself. And rare photographs of the town. And maps. We have items dating back to before the mill. Before the town was even called Perry Hollow. If we don&#x2019;t do something right now, all of it could be destroyed.&#x201d; <br>Kat looked to the museum again. Two firefighters had used the ladder truck to climb onto the roof, which they sprayed down with foam. Two others were in the process of knocking down the front door. When it gave way, they had to jump back to escape the flames rolling out of it. But they recovered quickly and ventured inside, hose blasting. Next to her, Emma Pulsifer cringed, no doubt imagining all that water damage. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a back door,&#x201d; Emma said with noticeable desperation. &#x201c;I know the fire&#x2019;s not out, but the town&#x2019;s entire history is in there. If we go through the back, we can try to salvage something.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This is a tragedy,&#x201d; Kat told her. &#x201c;It truly is. But I can&#x2019;t let you in there until the fire is completely out. I&#x2019;m sorry. It&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d; <br>Emma replied with a short, sad nod, the distant firelight reflecting in the tears that formed at the corners of her eyes. Quietly, she dialed her cell phone, pressed it to her ear, and turned away from Kat. <br>&#x201c;Connie? It&#x2019;s Emma. Where <i>are</i> you? Call me back immediately.&#x201d; <br>Kat looked over Emma&#x2019;s shoulder, checking to see if the crowd was still behaving. They were, although one man near the back was on the move. He towered over the rest of the crowd, showing less interest in the fire than in getting past those who were watching it. Kat only caught a brief glimpse of his face&#x2014;as pale as a full moon&#x2014;but it was all she needed. She&#x2019;d recognize those scars anywhere. <br>&#x201c;Henry?&#x201d; <br>The man didn&#x2019;t hear her. He continued working his way through the crowd, carrying what looked to be a small suitcase. Kat tried to follow him, practically shouting his name. <br>&#x201c;Henry Goll? Is that you?&#x201d; <br>She was in the thick of the crowd now, surrounded by people far taller than her five-foot frame. Kat cursed her shortness while squeezing between the two boys she had forced back onto the curb earlier that night. <br>Exiting on the other side of the crowd, she looked in all directions, seeing no sign of Henry. If it was even him. Kat had her doubts. The last time she had heard from him, he was living in Italy, making it unlikely he&#x2019;d be walking the streets of Perry Hollow at one-thirty in the morning. Perhaps she had spotted someone who merely looked like him. Maybe it was a trick of the fire-lit night. Or maybe she was simply seeing things. It was late, after all, and her dream had put Henry back into her thoughts. <br>Concluding that the dream was to blame, Kat whirled around, ready to return to Emma Pulsifer. She instead collided with a man standing on the edge of the crowd. <br>For a brief moment, she again thought it was Henry. The man was as solid as she remembered Henry being. Bumping into him felt like smacking into a brick wall. Kat almost said his name again, so certain was she that the man she had collided with was the long-lost Henry Goll. <br>Yet when the man spoke, she immediately realized her error. Henry&#x2019;s voice was deeper and more halting. The voice of the man she had bumped sounded high-pitched and startled. <br>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Sorry about that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was my fault.&#x201d; Kat wiped a strand of hair away from her face. &#x201c;I should have been watching where I was going.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Look before you leap, right?&#x201d; the man said. <br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; <br>Kat studied the man a moment, certain she had never seen him before. Since she knew practically everyone in Perry Hollow&#x2014;if not by name, then by sight&#x2014;she assumed he was a recent arrival. Or else a visitor. He had the appearance of someone who didn&#x2019;t belong. Although his voice contained no hint of an accent, he looked vaguely foreign, with deep-set eyes the color of coal, sharp cheekbones, and blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. <br>His clothes, too, were out of place in a jeans-and-T-shirt town like Perry Hollow. His collared shirt was buttoned all the way to the neck. His black pants were too tight and too short. An extra inch or two of white socks poked out from the cuffs before vanishing again into pointy shoes fastened by silver buckles. Over it all hung a black trench coat that was slightly frayed at the sleeves. <br>Kat introduced herself, hoping the stranger would do the same. <br>He merely nodded politely. &#x201c;Nice to meet you, Chief. Have a good night. Don&#x2019;t stay up too late.&#x201d; <br>He departed, his trench coat fluttering behind him. Kat watched him walk toward Main Street, still unable to shake the feeling that something wasn&#x2019;t quite right about the guy. And it wasn&#x2019;t just because he refused to give a name. It was the whole package&#x2014;his face, his clothes, his whole manner&#x2014;that unsettled her. Had the circumstances been different, she would have tried to follow him, just to find out where he was going. <br>Behind her, the crowd on the Freemans&#x2019; front lawn erupted into cheers and applause. They were clapping for the firefighters, who had started to emerge from the cloud of smoke still pouring out of the museum. <br>The fire had been conquered. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ...</p><h2>Roy Buchanan: American Axe</h2><p>Roy Buchanan was a &#x201c;guitarist's guitarist&#x201d; who shunned fame for a musical odyssey on America's roadhouse circuit with his battered Telecaster &#x2013; melding blues, country, jazz and rock like no player before or since.

They mingle aphorisms drawn from notebooks of 1875-79, years when worsening health forced Nietzsche toward an increasingly solitary existence. Like its predecessor, <i>Human, All Too Human II</i> is above all an act of resistance not only to the intellectual influences that Nietzsche felt called upon to critique, but to the basic physical facts of his daily life. It turns an increasingly sharply formulated genealogical method of analysis toward Nietzsche's persistent concerns&#x2015;metaphysics, morality, religion, art, style, society, politics and culture. The notebook entries included here offer a window into the intellectual sources behind Nietzsche's evolution as a philosopher, the reading and self-reflection that nourished his lines of thought. The linking of notebook entries to specific published aphorisms, included in the notes, allows readers of Nietzsche in English to trace for the first time the intensive process of revision through which he transformed raw notebook material into the finely crafted sequences of aphoristic reflection that signal his distinctiveness as a philosophical stylist.</p><p>Gary Handwerk is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Washington."This series will become the definitive resource for English readers."

The Storming of Berlin had been the Red Army&#39;s dream of vengeance ever since the German&#39;s invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941. Antony Beevor has reconstituted the experience of those millions caught up in the nightmare crescendo of the Third Reich&#39;s final defeat.</p><p>By December 1944, many of the 3 million citizens of Berlin had stopped giving the Nazi salute, and jokes circulated that the most practical Christmas gift of the season was a coffin. And for good reason, military historian Antony Beevor writes in this richly detailed reconstruction of events in the final days of Adolf Hitler's Berlin. Following savage years of campaigns in Russia, the Nazi regime had not only failed to crush Bolshevism, it had brought the Soviet army to the very gates of the capital. That army, ill-fed and hungry for vengeance, unloosed its fury on Berlin just a month later in a long siege that would cost hundreds of thousands of lives on both sides. But as Beevor recounts, the siege was also marked by remarkable acts of courage and even compassion. Drawing on unexplored Soviet and German archives and dozens of eyewitness accounts, Beevor brings us a harrowing portrait of the battle and its terrible aftermath, which would color world history for years to follow. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Antony Beevor is the author of Crete: The Battle and the Resistance (Runciman Prize), Stalingrad (Samuel Johnson Prize, Wolfson Prize for History and Hawthornden Prize), Berlin: The Downfall, The Battle for Spain (Premio La Vanguardia), D-Day: The Battle for Normandy (Prix Henry Malherbe and the RUSI Westminster Medal), The Second World War, and Ardennes 1944 (Prix Medicis shortlist).

The beautiful orphan, Albertine, is trapped in her lover&#39;s Paris apartment. She longs for his wealth and status, and hopes he will make her safe. Sickly and pampered, he is lured by her verve, the ease of her body, the pleasures he suspects are lurking in her past. Gradually, as they circle each other, their love starts to suffocate them both. This is a strange and captivating liaison, which starts on the wide sands of Normandy and ends in the city street, in a hidden world behind closed doors. And as Albertine struggles to escape, her only delight lies in her free, sensual women friend. Yet even to them she remains mysterious.

The oligarchs were fast-talking businessmen who laid claim to Russia's vast natural resources. The young reformers were an elite group of egghead economists who got to put their wild theories into action, with results that were sometimes inspiring, sometimes devastating. With unparalleled access and acute insight, Chrystia Freeland takes us behind the scenes and shows us how these two groups misused a historic opportunity to build a new Russia. Their achievements were considerable, but their mistakes will deform Russian society for generations to come.<br><br>Along with a gripping account of the incredible events in Russia's corridors of power, Freeland gives us a vivid sense of the buzz and hustle of the new Russia, and inside stories of the businesses that have beaten the odds and become successful and profitable. She also exposes the conflicts and compromises that developed when red directors of old Soviet firms and factories yielded to -- or fought -- the radically new ways of doing business. She delves into the loophole economy, where anyone who knows how to manipulate the new rules can make a fast buck. Sale of the Century is a fascinating fly-on-the-wall economic thriller -- an astonishing and essential account of who really controls Russia's new frontier.</p><p>Always something of an enigma to Westerners, Russia has become a veritable paradox in the decade following its transformation from communism to capitalism. In <i>Sale of the Century</i>, journalist Chrystia Freeland offers a riveting bird's-eye view of this conversion that should prove fascinating to everyone still hoping to do business there, and to anyone intrigued by the erstwhile superpower. Be forewarned, though: Freeland, who began reporting on the country in 1995 as Moscow bureau chief for the <i>Financial Times</i>, describes a nation of troubling extremes. The nation has evolved into a giddy utopia for some of its citizens, but one unable so far to handle its sudden affluence. The author portrays trendy Versace boutiques and bustling Mercedes-Benz dealerships lining Moscow's fashionable streets, whose sidewalks are patrolled by machine-gun-toting policemen trudging through the corrosive chemical waste used for melting the snow.<p> In well-written first-person accounts, Freeland goes on to describe how scrappy entrepreneurs made overnight fortunes and then lost them just as quickly to widespread corruption and the 1998 Russian stock market crash. By the end of the 1990s, the economy was half what it had been at the start of the decade, producing less than Belgium and only 25 percent more than Poland. Meanwhile, power blackouts, wildcat strikes, and water shortages had become commonplace. Additionally, the ordinary citizen often grew worse off than before the fall of communism, while a powerful few came to own nearly everything. This cautionary tale ends with a more "workaday economy" emerging from the wreckage, and the author's hope that Russia's economic leaders can stay this new, more-balanced course. All signs to date, however, leave her decidedly pessimistic. <i>--Howard Rothman</i></p>"Freeland's incisive and very readable work gives the reader a genuine sense for the roller-coaster quality of Russia's life in its difficult transition from Communism to God-knows-what!"<br>-- Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. national security advisor<br><br>"Sale of the Century is the best guide I've read to the most important story of the 1990s: Russia's stormy transition to capitalism. Freeland is a natural-born storyteller, and the stories matter, for she has used her access to many of the key players to identify the key moments on which the history turned. She's good at evoking character, too: Gaidar, Chubais, Yeltsin himself are all vivid and alive in all their complexity. Most of all, the whole book is informed by a high degree of economic and political intelligence, and her judgment that the reformers should have been more, rather than less, radical challenges conventional wisdom. The book confirms what insiders have known for some time: that this young Canadian journalist is a world-class expert on Russia and its future."<br>-- Michael Ignatieff, author of <i>Blood and Belonging</i> and <i>The Russian Album</i><br><br>"Chrystia Freeland gets across as no other author does the human factor in the transformation of Russia. This is precisely the element that often gets left out of both impersonal academic portraits and the calculations of Western policymakers. As Freeland shows vividly, it is impossible to understand the post-Soviet transition -- its benign side and its malign side -- without getting inside the heads of the people who have made it happen."<br>-- Timothy J.

We want to know that the days we live are actually making a difference and that there is a reason for what we do and for the difficulties we experience. We want to be sure that what we are standing for is worthwhile.<br> <br>But we also understand that to do so, we must break free from the factors that make us weak&#x2014;those issues that hold us back and undermine us.<br> <br>Because the truth of the matter is, it usually isn&#x2019;t when we&#x2019;re feeling tough and confident that we go looking for books on standing strong. It&#x2019;s not when we&#x2019;re secure and assured that we need encouragement. Rather, it&#x2019;s when the future is unsure. We become aware that we might not be as successful as we thought, and we long to know how to make it through&#x2014;and how to do so well. It&#x2019;s when the burdens get heavy, the challenges we face seem impossible, or the obstacles that stare at us from the horizon appear overwhelming. That&#x2019;s when we realize that we are in danger of being less than we&#x2019;d hoped to be or, worse, failing altogether. That&#x2019;s when we reach out for wisdom about how to stand.<br> <br>Whether we are eight years old, forty-eight, or eighty-eight, in the core of our hearts, we don&#x2019;t want failure to characterize the end of our stories. We don&#x2019;t want to be known for our worst mistakes and defeats, but for our greatest victories and triumphs.<br> <br>So what goes into the construction of a strong life? It&#x2019;s not just having a healthy body&#x2014;that&#x2019;s useful, but there is much more to it than that. Likewise, it is more than having a good job, plenty of money, or prestigious social standing in your community. How can you experience a strong, fruitful life? What does it take?<br> A LESSON FROM ARCHITECTURE: A STABLE FOUNDATION<p></p> <br><br> <br>To understand this, we can take a lesson from architecture, since we know what it takes to raise a strong building. In fact, it is a useful exercise to look at the edifices around us and throughout the world and consider what causes some structures to endure throughout the centuries of bad weather and harsh elements and others to topple within years of their construction. Naturally, we cannot go into a detailed examination of this topic. But what are the basic reasons some buildings can withstand the poundings of the harshest elements and others fail at the onset of bad weather?<br> <br>The most important factor, of course, is a stable foundation.<br> <br>We sometimes see tragically sad reports in the news. A two-story island resort in Thailand collapses without warning. A six-story building in Nairobi falls unexpectedly, killing twelve. A tenement building in New Delhi crashes to the ground, taking the lives of sixty-seven. Why? In such cases, heavy rains compromised already weak foundations and caused them to fall.<br> <br>We can see this in Israel and the Middle East, which experience seasons of severe storms and torrential rainfall. During such times, the landscape can change dramatically. The sunbaked ground, which seems so solid during the lengthy dry seasons, easily gives way when the raging waters pound against it. Gullies are formed as the force of the floods makes a path through whatever yields to it. Anything built on those shifting sands ultimately falls.<br> <br>Obviously, this is a problem for anyone who wishes to build any kind of permanent structure. If they want to ensure that their buildings will last, they must take more time, invest the additional resources, and make the extra effort to drill down past the layers of compacted sediment and anchor the structure to the immovable rock.<br> <br>The same is true for our lives. Jesus explained it like this:<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock. Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell&#x2014;and great was its fall.&#x201d; (Matt. 7:24&#x2013;28)<br> <br>No one is exactly sure where Jesus taught the Sermon on the Mount, but wherever that location was, we know it was near the Sea of Galilee and close to Capernaum, and Christ&#x2019;s listeners would have witnessed a visual representation of this truth. The surrounding landscape appeared safe, but in fact builders were required to dig down to the bedrock in order for the structures to remain secure. Perhaps they had even seen the remains of buildings that had been poorly founded on the sand and had slid and tumbled when the storms rolled in.<br> <br>Yet we must understand that even though Jesus is talking about an outward reality of a building&#x2019;s foundation, He is also describing an internal truth&#x2014;the importance of what we base our lives on and who we are on the inside.<br> <br>Understand, I am not talking merely about a backbone issue. It&#x2019;s not just about sticking to your ideals when the bad times come. We have all seen people who outwardly cling to their ideologies and values while privately turning to destructive coping mechanisms, hurting their relationships, or crumbling emotionally. Rather, the choices you make about what you believe go to the heart of who you are as a person. You can stand strong on the outside because, on the inside, your life is established on unshakable, unfailing truth. It matters what you believe and why you believe it.<br> <br>When suffering and disappointments come our way, if our lives are built on the right foundation, we can stand no matter what happens. If they&#x2019;re not, we won&#x2019;t. Oh, we may look sturdy while the sun is shining and everything is going our way, but when the winds and rains start pounding down, who we really are is evident. And sometimes, that&#x2019;s not a very good picture.<br> <br>Some people, when renovating a house, upgrade only the cosmetic aspects&#x2014;new hedges, nicer tiling, perhaps some enhanced lighting. They may also try to hide the defects with paint or cleverly positioned furniture and artwork.<br> <br>So it is when we &#x201c;renovate&#x201d; our lives&#x2014;we may try to get in shape, improve our health, dress nicer, embellish our rï¿½sumï¿½, and even become more outwardly religious. We try to impress others with our external qualities. We may also try to mask or diminish our pain, weaknesses, and fears with addictive substances or immoral behavior&#x2014;hoping that, somehow, they&#x2019;ll make us more courageous. But they don&#x2019;t. They undermine our confidence even further.<br> <br>All the while, we know that we actually need to replace the foundation and fix those things deep within us that are broken. But that is much more costly, and we wonder if anyone would even notice if we made the sacrifices to improve.<br> <br>Sadly, no matter how attractive a house is, if the foundation isn&#x2019;t solid, it will fall. This is one of the most important principles any of us will ever learn: Our life must be built on the right foundation.<br> <br>Jesus says that if we want to withstand the inevitable storms, our lives must be based on something that cannot be moved&#x2014;something that nothing in eternity can overturn. And friend, the only thing that will last forever is an intimate relationship with God. We may be drawn to things that promise to endure a long time, but nothing in this world will outlast the Lord Almighty.<br> <br>Psalm 90:2 reminds us that God existed before the dawn of time and will continue to remain when time itself is no more: &#x201c;Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.&#x201d;<br> <br>And, of course, from a verse many of us can quote, we know that He offers us an unshakable relationship with Himself: &#x201c;God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life&#x201d; (John 3:16).<br> <br>That whoever believes in Him shall not perish. Shall not topple or crash when the storms of life assail.<br> <br>That whoever believes in Him shall . . . have eternal life. Shall have a life that endures&#x2014;that is counted in eternity.<br> <br>So this is the very first step to having a strong life and an unshakable foundation&#x2014;having a relationship with God, which can come only through the death of Jesus on the cross. Friend, if you have never accepted Jesus as your Savior and Lord&#x2014;trusting in Him alone for your salvation&#x2014;then you&#x2019;re not building on the right foundation.<br> <br>Why? Because if you don&#x2019;t know Jesus, you are building on your own nature, which is damaged and unreliable. No one has to tell you what your sins, failings, and mistakes are; they come immediately to mind, no matter how hard you try to forget them. Likewise, you must understand that your own nature is limited and inadequate&#x2014;not only can you not see the future or control anything outside of your immediate scope of influence, but you will die one day. Any foundation you can come up with by yourself can only be temporary and insufficient.<br> <br>But Jesus, through His death on the cross, does these two things:<br> <br>First, Jesus eliminates that old, defective foundation and pays the penalty for everything you have ever done wrong. Your sins separate you from God&#x2014;from the only One who is holy, eternal, and unlimited, and who can make your life strong. You need Christ to haul all of that old, collapsing, decaying foundation away.<br> <br>Second, Jesus makes you spiritually and eternally alive. He gives you a new nature and, therefore, a new foundation on which to establish your life.<br> <br>Understanding this is at the heart of accepting what Jesus has done for you. Some people believe that following God is simply about observing the guidelines He has given in His Word. That is certainly part of it. But unless you are spiritually alive through the salvation Jesus offers you, you don&#x2019;t really have a relationship with God. You are merely submitting to rules.<br> KICKING AGAINST THE GOADS<p></p> <br>Perhaps one of the best examples of the necessity of knowing God through a new foundation is the apostle Paul. Most people would recognize the apostle Paul as a man who stood strong&#x2014;and I would heartily agree with them. After all, apart from Jesus, few have had such an incredible influence on the church as he has. Paul went on three fruitful missionary journeys; founded many churches, which, in turn, planted many more; and wrote almost half of the New Testament. Certainly, we can say that the life of the apostle Paul continues to have a powerful impact to this day.<br> <br>But we also need to recognize that his story could have ended very differently.<br> <br>At one time, Paul was called Saul, and he had all the prestige this world had to offer. He was a respected member of one of the most powerful religious ruling classes, the Pharisees. He was trained under Gamaliel, one of the greatest rabbis of the first century. Saul was known and admired among his peers as a faithful and talented man who was full of zeal for his nation.<br> <br>In fact, Saul was so passionate about his beliefs that he was willing to kill for them. As a committed Jew, he observed the laws of God to the letter. He also persecuted the newfound Christian church and was even present for the execution of the first Christian martyr, Stephen (Acts 7:59&#x2013;8:1). Those in his community may have thought Saul had it all&#x2014;he was a religious giant and a force to be reckoned with. And the reality is that we might have thought so as well. We might have looked at Saul and seen a wealthy, educated man with a lot of power and an untouchable pedigree.<br> <br>But we would have been looking at the wrong things. The truth of the matter was that Saul was on track for a life full of futility, weakness, murder, and regret. Yes, Saul was committed to God, but he did not truly have a relationship with Him.<br> <br>Thankfully, that was all before Saul met Jesus and became Paul.<br> <br>Perhaps you recall the story. &#x201c;As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &#x2018;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&#x2019; And [Saul] said, &#x2018;Who are You, Lord?&#x2019; And He said, &#x2018;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting&#x2019;?&#x201d; (Acts 9:3&#x2013;5).<br> <br>The man who was willing to do anything for God finally met Him face-to-face on that road to Damascus. And that meeting completely transformed his life.<br> <br>Later, when Paul retells the story, he includes an interesting detail. He says, &#x201c;I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, &#x2018;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads&#x2019;?&#x201d; (Acts 26:14).<br> <br>It is hard for you to kick against the goads.<br> <br>Unless you raise cattle, that phrase probably does not have much meaning. Farmers use a goad to direct oxen or other beasts of burden as they plow fields. Usually it is a stick with a pointed piece of metal on the end that the farmer can use as a prod. A rebellious ox might fight back, kicking against the goad, which actually drives the sharp iron tip deeper into the animal&#x2019;s flesh, injuring it. The more the ox fights, the more it wounds and weakens itself.<br> <br>The picture is striking. Saul thought he was living a strong life for God because of his legalistic adherence to the Law, which is the tool&#x2014;or goad&#x2014;that the Lord uses to direct us in how to walk with Him. But Paul was really fighting against the goad&#x2014;against Scripture&#x2014;because Scripture&#x2019;s true purpose has always been to lead humanity to the salvation Jesus offers (Rom. 7:7&#x2013;25).<br> <br>So Paul&#x2019;s erroneous beliefs (and the acceptance of his fellow Pharisees) were actually weakening him, undermining his life and his relationship with the Lord. He missed the very Messiah God&#x2019;s Word was pointing to (John 5:39)! We will talk about this in detail in the next chapter.<br> <br>But I wonder how many people reading this book are doing the same? Following God but not really knowing Him. Wanting to build an admirable and joyous life but ending up with destruction and despair. Thinking they are living for the Lord but unwittingly allowing their faulty beliefs to undermine their lives and relationship with Him. Like Paul, kicking against the goads.<br> <br>Friend, is this you? Are you a moral person who lives a good life&#x2014;loving others and doing what you think is right but finding a lack of strength, joy, or meaning in your daily existence? Do you know of God but not know Him personally? Do you find a lack of stability, security, or purpose in your life? Are you missing His presence, provision, and peace?<br> <br>Like Paul, you can change course. You need to start by looking closely at yourself: Are you just observing Judeo-Christian rules without actually having a personal relationship with God Himself? This comes through accepting Jesus Christ, acknowledging Him as your Lord and Savior. As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3:11, &#x201c;No man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&#x201d;<br> <br>So how do you do this? How do you make a ...</p><h2>The Other Alice: The Story of Alice Liddell and Alice in Wonderland</h2><p>Examines the Victorian childhood of a young girl named Alice Liddell, who was the favorite child friend of math teacher Charles Dodgson, the man who penned Alice in Wonderland. By the author of Linnea in Monet&#39;s Garden.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: SwedishThe author of Linnea in Monet's Garden (1987) explores the connection between Alice Liddell, the book Alice, and its creator in an inviting array of anecdotes, biographical details, descriptions of the Oxford setting, photos (many by Dodgson, still renowned as a photographer of children), period illustrations, and Eriksson's precisely detailed art. Bj&#x201d;rk introduces this wealth of material with an engaging account (lively with ``conversation'') of Alice's first telling on a river picnic. The bulk of the book details the peculiar ups and downs of the friendship between the child and the confirmed bachelor (whose best friends were always little girls, although there's no hint that these ties were anything but deliciously whimsical and rather cerebral), the two of whom apparently lost interest in each other as she got older (Mrs. Liddell would also, periodically and inexplicably, try to terminate a friendship that would then be reinstated with full honor). Meanwhile, much of the pair's playful interaction (especially concerning logic and numbers) was incorporated into Alice. The author wraps up her account with what happened later to the people, the books, and Oxford itself. Eriksson's profuse, exquisite illustrations are as carefully researched as the text. An entrancing portrait of the genesis of a classic, of a unique friendship, and of Victorian Oxford. Addenda include a map, family lists, puzzle solutions, ``Societies for Alice and Carroll Friends,'' and bibliographies of Dodgson's books and the author's sources. Charming.

Neither critics nor readers reacted with shock to its matter-of-fact depiction of a gay couple and their domestic mï¿½nage--perhaps because few of them knew what the book was about. Henry Blake Fuller was nothing if not a <i>subtle</i> writer. Held in high esteem by his contemporaries, he nevertheless faded from public view soon after <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i>'s chilly reception. The critical reevaluation of Fuller's work began only in 1970, when Edmund Wilson wrote in the <i>New Yorker</i> that Fuller was America's premier novelist of the early 20th century, ranking him above both Stephen Crane and William Dean Howells. Now, for the first time since 1919, what Wilson called Fuller's best novel has been restored to print. <p> The novel's eponymous narrator is a young college instructor newly arrived in the university town of Churchton--a fictional stand-in for Evanston, Illinois, home of Northwestern University. Most unexpectedly, Cope finds himself besieged with admirers, including an older, clearly gay man and a widow whose house is full of eligible female boarders with artistic pretensions. ("Amy plays. Hortense paints. Carolyn is a poet.") Cope, however, can think of nothing but his friend Arthur Lemoyne. Although the nature of their relationship is never made explicit, for the initiated, Fuller's novel is full of clues. Once Lemoyne has moved in with Cope, for instance, elderly Joseph Foster notices him "always hanging over the other man's chair; always finding a reason to put his hand on his shoulder...." It makes Foster think of "a young married couple at a Saratoga hotel" who "made their partiality too public," causing a lady to complain that "they brought the manners of the bed-chamber into the drawing-room." </p><p> Cope and Lemoyne make for a happy couple, their domestic tranquility only interrupted by Lemoyne's penchant for amateur theatrics. Performing in an all-male musical comedy, Lemoyne's female impersonation is a little too convincing for Churchton's sensibilities, and when he makes a pass at a straight actor, he is hounded from both his studies and his job. "A thing may be done too thoroughly," as the widow Phillips remarks. Still, the incident is played as satire rather than tragedy, and refreshingly, same-sex love itself never registers as tortured or doomed. Instead, Bertram Cope's concerns are as practical as possible: why married couples have so much stuff, where to get it, the excellence of Arthur Lemoyne's coffee and toast. In this sense, <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i> is the most modern gay novel imaginable: its concern is not to make a case for the love that dare not speak its name, or even to speak its name at all. Instead, it contemplates how--in a world given over to the many rituals of heterosexual love--a thoroughly average gay couple can make themselves a home and a place in society. In this, the greatest flaw of <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i> is also its greatest strength. Ambivalent, charming, emotionally inert, in the annals of gay literature Bertram Cope is exceptional for his very ordinariness.</p>In 1919, when he was sixty-two, Henry Blake Fuller published <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i>. This audacious book with several homosexual characters revolves around a young English instructor in a middle western university town patterned on Evanston, Illinois. Rejected by every New York publisher, Fuller self-published and the book received scant notice or unintelligent reviews. Discouraged, Fuller burned the original manuscript. It took ten years before he ventured to publish another novel. James Huneker, Fuller's contemporary, loved <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i>. He read it three times and wrote to Fuller, "Its portraiture and psychological strokes fill me with envy and joy...you are implacable. Stendhal of the lake!" Fifty years later, critic Edmund Wilson, in a New Yorker article on Henry Blake Fuller entitled "The Art of Making It Flat", called <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i> Fuller's best book. He wrote, "It has a philosophic theme...which raises it well above the fiction of social surfaces of the school of William Dean Howells." The Turtle Point Press edition is the first republication of <i>Bertram Cope's Year</i> since 1919.</p><h2>How To Know If Someone Is Worth Pursuing In Two Dates Or Less</h2><p>He feels a strong attraction to her.

They were capital warships of the &#x201c;ironclad&#x201d; series; the heaviest dreadnoughts constructed in the Midland yards. Balloons the color of flame, shuriken-thrower turrets studding their inflatables, vomiting black exhaust into opiate skies. <br>The flagship leading the trio was a hundred feet long, three red banners embroidered with lotus blooms trailing at her stern. Her name flowed down her bow in broad, bold kanji&#x2014;a warning to any fool who would stand in her way. <br>LADY IZANAMI&#x2019;S HUNGER. <br>If Brother Jubei felt any trepidation about serving on a ship named for the Dark Mother&#x2019;s appetites, he hid it well. He stood at the stern, warm inside the brass shell of his atmos-suit despite the freezing wind. Trying to still the butterflies in his stomach, quiet his pounding heart. Repeating the mantra: &#x201c;skin is strong, flesh is weak, skin is strong, flesh is weak,&#x201d; seeking his center. Yet try as he might, he couldn&#x2019;t still the discontent ringing inside his head. <br>The fleet&#x2019;s captain stood at the railing, surveying the Iishi Mountains below. His atmos-suit was decorated with ornate designs, brass fixtures and pistons embossed with steel-gray filigree. A mechabacus clicked and chittered on his chest; a device of counting beads and vacuum tubes, singing the tuneless song of windup insects. A dozen desiccated tiger tails hung from the spaulders covering the captain&#x2019;s shoulders. They were rumored to have been a gift from the great Fleetmaster of the Tora Chapterhouse, Old Kioshi himself. <br>The captain&#x2019;s name was Montaro, though his crew preferred to call him &#x201c;Scourge of the Gaijin.&#x201d; He was a veteran of the Morcheba invasion, had commanded the Guild fleet supporting Shogunate ground troops against the round-eye barbarians across the Eastborne Sea. But when the war effort had begun disintegrating in the wake of the Shogun&#x2019;s assassination, Chapterhouse Kigen had recalled the captain and set him tracking a new foe, back on Shiman shores. To Brother Jubei&#x2019;s great pride, of all the newly Awakened Shatei in Kigen, Second Bloom Kensai had selected <i>him</i> to serve as the Scourge&#x2019;s new aide. <br>&#x201c;Do you require anything, Captain?&#x201d; Jubei stood at the Scourge&#x2019;s back, a respectful distance away, eyes downcast. <br>&#x201c;A sniff of our quarry would suffice.&#x201d; Faint annoyance in the crackling buzz that passed for the captain&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Other than that, this weak flesh abides.&#x201d; He touched a switch, spoke into his wrist. &#x201c;Do you see anything up there, Shatei Masaki?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No movement, Captain.&#x201d; The lookout&#x2019;s reply was faint, despite him being perched only thirty feet above their heads. &#x201c;But this forest canopy is thick as fog. Even with telescopics, we&#x2019;re hard-pressed to pierce it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Clever rabbit,&#x201d; the Scourge hissed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s heard our engines and gone to ground.&#x201d; <br>Jubei watched a spire of rock drift past their starboard; a black iceberg in a sea of maple and cedar. Thin cloud clung to the mountaintops, peaks crusted in snow, the rumble of engines and heavy <i>thupthupthup</i> of propellers echoing in the forest beneath them. Autumn cupped the Iishi Mountains at the edge of a cold embrace, the colors of rust waiting at the edge of the stage. <br>The Scourge sighed, hollow and metallic. <br>&#x201c;I know it to be the impulse of my weak flesh, but I confess I missed these skies.&#x201d; <br>Jubei blinked back his surprise, wondering if he should engage his commanding officer in idle chatter. After long empty moments, the young Guildsman decided it would be impolite not to respond, speaking with hesitance. <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; How long were you stationed in Morcheba, Captain?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eight years. Eight years with nothing but blood-drinkers and skinthieves for prey.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is it true the skies above the round-eye lands are blue?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The Scourge shook his head. &#x201c;Not anymore. Closer to mauve now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I would enjoy seeing them one day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, the sooner we butcher our rabbit, the sooner we get back there.&#x201d; Gauntleted fingers drummed the wooden railing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d hoped to run him down before he reached the Iishi. But he&#x2019;s resourceful, this one.&#x201d; <br>Jubei looked at the ships around them, bristling with weaponry and mercenary marines. The discontent rapped at the inside of his teeth, demanding to be let out for air. <br>&#x201c;Forgive me, Captain,&#x201d; he ventured. &#x201c;I know Old Kioshi&#x2019;s son is a traitor. I know he must be punished for crafting the thunder tiger&#x2019;s wings, aiding in its escape. But this fleet&nbsp;&#x2026; all this effort to kill one boy seems&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excessive?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hai.&#x201d; A slow nod. &#x201c;I have heard rumor that Old Kioshi and Second Bloom Kensai were as brothers. That Kensai-sama raised the traitor as his own son. But, forgive my temerity&#x2014;does it not seem to you there is more important prey for us to be hunting?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You speak of Yoritomo&#x2019;s assassin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And the Kagï¿½ rebels who shelter her.&#x201d; <br>The Scourge glanced at him, grim amusement in his voice. <br>&#x201c;Shelter her? She is not exactly hiding from us, young brother. Visiting all four clan capitals in the past fortnight. Bringing the skinless to the edge of outright rebellion. Slaying the Shogun of this nation simply by <i>looking</i> at him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All the more reason to hunt her down, surely?&#x201d; Jubei felt righteous anger curdle his voice. &#x201c;The citizenry say we in the Lotus Guild are <i>afraid</i> of her. A slip of a girl. A <i>child</i>. Do you know what they call her, Captain? The skinless, gathered in their filthy gambling pits and smoke houses? Do you know the name they give her?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stormdancer,&#x201d; the Scourge replied. <br>&#x201c;Worse,&#x201d; Jubei spat. &#x201c;They call her &#x2018;the girl all Guildsmen fear.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>A hollow chuckle echoed inside the Scourge&#x2019;s helm. &#x201c;Not this Guildsman.&#x201d; <br>Jubei lost his voice, stared at his feet, wondering if he had spoken out of turn. The Scourge glanced at one of their support vessels, the <i>Lotus Wind,</i> rumbling a mile off their stern, twin trails of blue-black exhaust spewing from the ironclad&#x2019;s engines. He touched a switch at his chest, spoke again into his wrist, iron in his voice. <br>&#x201c;Captain Hikita, report.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; o sign,&#x201d; came the faint reply, almost inaudible through the static. &#x201c;&#x2026; ut we are almost directly abov&nbsp;&#x2026; site where the <i>Resplendent Glory</i> picked&nbsp;&#x2026; tsune girl last summer&nbsp;&#x2026; ronghold should be&nbsp;&#x2026; rby.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;He cannot be far,&#x201d; the Scourge growled. &#x201c;He left the river only last night, and on foot. Have your munitioneers prepare a fire barrage. Five-hundred-foot spread from the water&#x2019;s edge. Time to flush this rabbit from his hole.&#x201d; <br>Confirmation crackled down the comms channels, tinged with reverb. <br>The <i>Lotus Wind</i> banked ponderously and trekked back south, the drone of its propellers smudged across the sky. Jubei saw fire crews swarming over the decks like tiny armored ants, loading incendiary barrels, setting ignition charges. He was scanning the forest canopy when the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s captain signaled the barrage was finally primed and ready. The Scourge&#x2019;s voice hissed down the all-comms frequency. <br>&#x201c;Lookouts, eyes open. Captain Hikita, commence bombardment.&#x201d; <br>Jubei saw a cluster of black shapes fall from the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s belly, tumble down into the autumn shroud below. A second later, all peace shattered, a series of dull whumping booms accompanying the blossoms of flame bursting amidst the trees, unfurling a hundred feet into the air and buffeting the <i>Hunger</i> like a child&#x2019;s toy. Faint vibrations pressed against Jubei&#x2019;s metal skin as the <i>Wind</i> cruised the shuddering riverbank, setting huge swathes of the forest ablaze. <br>The flames caught and spread, licking autumn leaves with fevered tongues, a curtain of choking soot and char drifting through the woods on blackened feet. Off the starboard side, their second escort, <i>Void&#x2019;s Truth</i> dumped a second cluster of firebombs amidst the ancient trees, trembling reverb echoing down the river valley. Flocks of shrieking birds took to the wing, animals of all shapes and sizes fleeing north through the undergrowth, away from the grasping flames. Jubei watched it all unfold with a kind of fascination&#x2014;the power of his Guild&#x2019;s technology obliterating what had taken centuries to grow in a matter of moments. <br>&#x201c;Any sign?&#x201d; the Scourge asked over all-comms. <br>&#x201c;Negative,&#x201d; reported the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s lookouts. <br>&#x201c;No sign,&#x201d; from the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s eyes above. <br>The <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s reply popped with faint static. &#x201c;We have contact. Three hundred yards, north-northeast. Acknowledge?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have him,&#x201d; reported the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s lookout. &#x201c;Seventy degrees starboard.&#x201d; <br>The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s pilot kicked the engines to full burn, the propellers&#x2019; song rising an octave as they swung about to begin pursuit. Jubei engaged his telescopics, scanning the shifting chinks in the forest canopy as a sudden sweat burned his eyes. The vista below crackling sharp in his vision. Smoke coiled amidst moss-encrusted giants. Falling leaves and fleeing birds. An empire of bark and stone. But at last, yes, he saw him, he <i>saw</i> him&#x2014;a thin figure in dirty gray, darting between two gnarled and looming maples. <br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; Jubei cried. &#x201c;There he is!&#x201d; <br>Short dark hair. Pale skin. Gone. <br>&#x201c;Ground crews, prepare for pursuit.&#x201d; The Scourge&#x2019;s command was calm as millpond water. &#x201c;&#x2019;Thrower teams full alert. Second Bloom has ordered us to liquidate target on sight.&#x201d; <br>The <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s shuriken-throwers opened up, followed by the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s; twin batteries of razor-sharp stars spraying from their flanks and shredding the curtain of curling leaves below. Severed branches crashed earthward, the <i>chug!chug!chug!chug!</i> of the &#x2019;throwers ringing over the rush of starving flames. Jubei thought he saw their quarry flitting amidst the undergrowth, a hail of gleaming death raining all around him. The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s marines were performing final weapons checks, readying to drop into the woods below. Flames to the south. Troops and spinning death from above. Ironclads overhead. <br>Jubei smiled to himself, surging flames reflected on metal skin. The rabbit had led them on a long chase, to be sure. But at last, his luck had come to an end. <br>The Scourge turned from the railing, grim satisfaction in his voice. &#x201c;You may get to see Morcheba sooner than you&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>A flash of light. <br>Searing. Magnesium-white. It took a split second for the shock wave to catch up to the flare. Jubei saw the air around him grow brighter, highlights glinting on brass skin. And then came thunder&#x2014;a shuddering, bone-shaking report sending <i>Lady Izanami&#x2019;s Hunger</i> skidding sideways across the sky, engines wailing in soot-smeared protest. Jubei lost his balance, and to his shame, clutched the Scourge&#x2019;s arm to stop himself falling. <br>A rush of superheated air. Tortured metal screaming, the hollow thudding booms of secondary explosions. Jubei turned, breath catching in his lungs, unable to comprehend what he was seeing. <br>The ironclad off their starboard. <i>Void&#x2019;s Truth</i>. A complement of twenty Guild marines, twelve Lotusmen, four Artificers, six officers and thirty crew. All of them. <br>They were falling from the sky. <br>The inflatable was simply gone, a long, ragged fireball swelling within a blackened exoskeleton, great flaming hands reaching down to incinerate anything on her deck. Cables snapping, motors whining as she reared up under unrestrained thrust, bow pointing into the sky even as they plummeted earthward. The comms system was filled with screaming; tiny burning figures spilling over the railings and tumbling toward maws of rock hundreds of feet below. Jubei could see a few crewmen struggling with the aft lifeboat, bent low in terror. Another deafening explosion sounded as the <i>Truth</i>&#x2019;s chi reserves ignited, her backside blew apart in a shower of blazing shrapnel, and she spun end over end toward her grave. <br>&#x201c;What in the First Bloom&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; the Scourge bellowed into the comms system. &#x201c;What hit us? Report!&#x201d; <br>The <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s crew was in chaos. Marines scrambling for the secondary shuriken-throwers. Shouted orders. Running feet. Fire teams on the dirigible yelling for target coordinates, lookouts aiming their telescopics through the billowing smoke, ashes falling like rain. Jubei saw the blue-white flare of rocket-trails through the haze off the starboard side; brothers who had survived the explosion and managed to engage their jet packs. <br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Survivors!&#x201d; <br>The closest Shatei was forty feet from the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s railing when it took him. A flash of white amidst the smoke, the squealing crunch of ruptured metal, a strangled shout. And then Jubei saw the rocket pack flare and die, a haze of red, and the brother tumbled from the sky, the top half of his body struggling to keep pace with his legs. <br>&#x201c;First Bloom, save us,&#x201d; he whispered. <br>Jubei felt the <i>Hunger</i> shudder, heard a bass-thick crackling across blood-red skies. A sound that shivered the flesh inside his skin, rivets squealing, deck trembling under his feet like a child beneath his sheets in the thick, dead of night. The unmistakable roar of thunder. And yet, aside from the smoke, the skies around them were clear as polished glass&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Battle stations!&#x201d; the Scourge roared. &#x201c;Battle stations!&#x201d; <br>Jubei heard the shuriken-throwers arcing up again; a heavy <i>chug!chug!chug!chug!,</i> the hiss of pressurized gas, the clunking clatter of feeder belts. The sky around them sparkled with shards of razored steel, withering death sprayed blindly into the smoke. The mechabacus upon his chest spat a chattering spiel, confirmation requests from Chapterhouse Kigen flooding his inputs. His hands were shaking too hard to respond. <br>Screams again. Cries of &#x201c;Contact! Contact!&#x201d; A pinprick of flame off the stern. Jubei looked behind in time to see that same white silhouette skirting the <i>Lotus Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable, talons rending the reinforced canvas of their sister ship like damp rice-paper. <br>The world held still for a fleeting second, the deathly hush between one heartbeat and the next. Jubei looked across the space between him and that white blur, a sky of spinning steel and acrid smoke, and in that tiny, fragile moment, he saw her: a black shape, long hair whipping in an ember wind, crouched between two metal wings on the back of an absolute impossibility. And as its long and terrible talons ripped the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable asunder, he saw a flash of orange light in the girl&#x2019;s hand, a tiny flame at the end of a handheld flare, tumbling from her fingertips toward the escaping hydrogen. <br>And then light. Rippling, deafening light. <br>The explosion rocked the <i>Hunger</i> on to her starboard, the shock wave sending four marines over the side and into the abyss. Fire blossomed, the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s inflatable tearing apart like an overfull bladder, timbers snapping, choking smoke. The Scourge bellowing, the chatter of shuriken fire, the roar of wounded engines, the ironclad spinning like a child&#x2019;s toy as the white shape swooped around and down the port side amidst a hail of &#x2019;thrower fire, taking the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s engine off at her shoulder. <br> <i>So fast. So impossibly fast.</i> <br>&#x201c;Concentrate fire! All &#x2019;throwers fire! FIRE!&#x201d; <br>The shape wheeled away, keeping the <i>Wind</i>&#x2019;s tumbling corpse between itself and the <i>Hunger</i> until it was well out of range, diving behind a towering knuckle of black mountain stone. Jubei heard a rumbling crash as the <i>Wind</i> hit bottom, flaring like a second sun as her chi tanks exploded, setting the autumn valley ablaze. The pilot was spinning the wheel beside him, the <i>Hunger</i>&#x2019;s nose swinging towar...</p><h2>Desperately Seeking A Duke (The Heiress Brides, 1)</h2><p><p>The only way for vicar's daughter Phoebe Millbury to inherit a family fortune is to find herself a duke&#x2015;just as her late grandfather demanded in his will.

A THREE EVANGELISTS NOVEL</p><p><b>Fred Vargas</b> was born in Paris in 1957. A historian and archaeologist by profession, she is now a bestselling novelist. Her books have sold over 10 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 45 languages.<b>I</b><br><br>&#x2018;Pierre, something&#x2019;s wrong with the garden,&#x2019; said sophia.<br><br>She opened the window and examined the patch of ground. She knew it by heart, every blade of grass. What she saw sent a shiver down her spine.<br><br>Pierre was reading the newspaper over his breakfast. Maybe that was why Sophia looked out of the window so often. To see what the weather was like. That&#x2019;s something you do quite often when you get up in the morning. And whenever the weather was dull, she would think of Greece, of course. These sessions standing at the window had, over time, become full of nostalgia, which swelled inside her some mornings to the point of resentment. Then it would pass. But this particular morning, something was wrong.<br><br>&#x2018;Pierre, there&#x2019;s a tree in the garden.&#x2019;<br><br>She sat down beside him.<br><br>&#x2018;Pierre, look at me.&#x2019;<br><br>Wearily, Pierre raised his face towards his wife. Sophia adjusted the scarf around her throat, a habit she had kept since her days as an opera singer. Protect your voice. Twenty years earlier, on one of the stone terraces of the open-air amphitheatre in Orange, Pierre had proposed to her with a cascade of protestations of love and undying certainties. Just before a performance.<br><br>Sophia cupped in her hand the gloomy face of the newspaper reader.<br><br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s eating you, Sophia?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I just told you something.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You did?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I said: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a tree in the garden&#x201d;.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I heard you. That&#x2019;s pretty normal, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There&#x2019;s a tree in the garden that wasn&#x2019;t there yesterday.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, what about it? Am I supposed to react or something?&#x2019;<br><br>Sophia was not feeling calm. She didn&#x2019;t know whether it was because of the newspaper, or the weary look, or the business about the tree, but it was clear that something was not right.<br><br>&#x2018;Pierre, explain to me how a tree can turn up in a garden all by itself.&#x2019;<br><br>Pierre shrugged. He really could not care less.<br><br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s the problem? Trees reproduce themselves. A seed, a cutting, a graft: that&#x2019;s all it takes. They grow into mighty forests in this climate. I imagine you know that.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t a cutting. It&#x2019;s a tree! A young tree, standing up straight, with branches and everything, planted all by itself a metre or so from the end wall. How did it get there?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It got there because the gardener planted it.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;The gardener&#x2019;s been gone two months and I haven&#x2019;t found a replacement. So, no, it wasn&#x2019;t the gardener.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, it doesn&#x2019;t bother me. Don&#x2019;t expect me to get worked up about a little tree standing by the end wall.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you even want to get up and have a look? Can&#x2019;t you just do that?&#x2019;<br><br>Pierre heaved himself to his feet. His reading had been interrupted.<br><br>&#x2018;See?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, of course I can see. It&#x2019;s a tree.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t there yesterday.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Maybe.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Not maybe. It wasn&#x2019;t there. So what are we going to do about it? Any ideas?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why should I have?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That tree frightens me.&#x2019;<br><br>Pierre laughed. He even put an affectionate arm round her. Briefly.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not joking, Pierre. It frightens me.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, it doesn&#x2019;t frighten me,&#x2019; he said, sitting down again. &#x2018;In fact, having a tree turn up is quite nice. You just leave it in peace and that&#x2019;s that. And you might perhaps give me a bit of peace about it. Someone got the wrong garden, I dare say. Their problem, not ours.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But it was planted during the night, Pierre!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All the more likely someone got the wrong garden. Or perhaps it&#x2019;s a present. Have you thought of that? One of your fans wanted to honour you discreetly on your fiftieth birthday. Fans get up to all kind of tricks, especially those mouse-type fans, the obsessive ones, who won&#x2019;t give their names. Go and see, there might be a message.&#x2019;<br><br>Sophia thought for a bit. The idea wasn&#x2019;t entirely ridiculous. Pierre had decreed that her fans fell into two camps. There were the mouse-type fans, who were timid, agitated, silent, but unshakeable. Pierre had once known a mouse transport a whole bag of rice into a rubber boot over the course of a winter, grain by grain. That&#x2019;s the way they are, mouse-fans. Then there are the rhino-type fans, equally to be dreaded in their way: noisy, loud-mouthed, very sure of themselves. Inside these two categories, Pierre had developed masses of sub-groups. Sophia couldn&#x2019;t remember them all. Pierre despised the fans who had come before him and the ones who came after him, in other words, all of them. But maybe he was right about the tree. Possibly; not certainly. She heard Pierre go into his &#x2018;Bye-see-you-tonight-don&#x2019;t-worry-yourself-about-it&#x2019; routine, and then she was alone.<br><br>With the tree.<br><br>She went to take a look. Gingerly, as if it might explode in her face.<br><br>No, of course there wasn&#x2019;t a message. At the foot of the young tree was a circle of freshly dug earth. What sort of tree was it? Sophia walked round it a few times, grudgingly, feeling hostile. She was inclined to think it was a beech. She was also inclined to uproot it now, to tear it out, but being slightly superstitious, she dared not attack a living thing, even a plant. The truth is that few people would tear up a tree that had done them no harm.<br><br>It took a long time to find a book that would help. Apart from opera, the life of the donkey and Greek myths, Sophia had not had time to become expert on anything. A beech tree, perhaps? Hard to say without seeing its leaves. She went through the index of the book, to see if there were any trees called <i>sophia</i>-something in Latin. It could be some sort of disguised homage, the kind of convoluted thing a mouse-type fan might think up. That would be quite reassuring. But no, no <i>sophias</i>. Well, perhaps a species by the name of <i>stelios</i> something. That would not be nice at all. Stelios was nothing like a mouse, or a rhino. And he did worship trees. After the cascade of declarations by Pierre on the terraces in Orange, Sophia had wondered how she was going to leave Stelios, and had sung less well than usual. And the immediate reaction of her mad Greek had been to try and drown himself. They had fished him out of the Mediterranean, gasping for breath and floating like an idiot. When they were teenagers, Sophia and Stelios used to love to go out of Delphi along mountain paths with donkeys and goats, playing at being &#x2018;Ancient Greeks&#x2019;, as they called it. And then the imbecile had tried to drown himself. Luckily there was the cascade of declarations by Pierre. Nowadays, Sophia was still trying to locate a few trickles of it. Stelios? Was he a threat? Would he do something like this? Yes, he might. When he had been pulled out of the Mediterranean, he had been suddenly galvanised, and started screaming like a madman. Her heart beating too fast, Sophia made an effort to get to her feet, drink a glass of water and look out of the window.</p><h2>Little Book of Lettering</h2><p>Typography is always one of the designer's first considerations when it comes to making a statement, and in recent years the world of lettering and type has exploded in an unprecedented wave of creative discovery.

My classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day. It was one of the first big words we learned.&nbsp; Impedimenta&#x2014;the baggage that impedes one&#x2019;s progress. So I was Joe Impedimenta. Or Dash. A lot of people thought they called me Dash because of football. I was fast, and I scored my share of touchdowns. But the guys at an all-boys Catholic school usually didn&#x2019;t give you nicknames to make you feel better about yourself. They didn&#x2019;t call me Dash because of what I could do on the football field; they called me Dash because of what I could not do in the classroom. I talked like Morse code. Dot-dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dash. &#x201c;You gu-gu-gu-gu-guys sh-sh-sh-sh-shut up!&#x201d; <br>My impedimenta was a stutter. It wasn&#x2019;t always bad. When I was at home with my brothers and sister, hanging out with my neighborhood friends, or shooting the bull on the ball field, I was fine, but when I got thrown into a new situation or a new school, had to read in front of the class, or wanted to ask out a girl, I just couldn&#x2019;t do it. My freshman year of high school, because of the stutter, I got an exemption from public speaking. Everybody else had to get up and make a presentation at the morning assembly, in front of 250 boys. I got a pass. And everybody knew it. Maybe they didn&#x2019;t think much of it&#x2014;they had other things to worry about&#x2014;but I did. It was like having to stand in the corner with the dunce cap. Other kids looked at me like I was stupid. They laughed. I wanted so badly to prove I was like everybody else. Even today I can remember the dread, the shame, the absolute rage, as vividly as the day it was happening. There were times I thought it was the end of the world, my impedimenta. I worried that the stutter was going to be my epitaph. And there were days I wondered: How would I ever beat it?<br> It&#x2019;s a funny thing to say, but even if I could, I wouldn&#x2019;t wish away the darkest days of the stutter. That impedimenta ended up being a godsend for me. Carrying it strengthened me and, I hoped, made me a better person. And the very things it taught me turned out to be invaluable lessons for my life as well as my chosen career. <br><br>I started worrying about my stutter back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in grade school. When I was in kindergarten, my parents sent me to a speech pathologist at Marywood College, but it didn&#x2019;t help much, so I went only a few times. Truth was, I didn&#x2019;t let the stutter get in the way of things that really mattered to me. I was young for my grade and always little for my age, but I made up for it by demonstrating I had guts. On a dare, I&#x2019;d climb to the top of a burning culm dump, swing out over a construction site, race under a moving dump truck. If I could visualize myself doing it, I knew I could do it. It never crossed my mind that I couldn&#x2019;t. As much as I lacked confidence in my ability to communicate verbally, I always had confidence in my athletic ability. Sports was as natural to me as speaking was unnatural. And sports turned out to be my ticket to acceptance&#x2014;and more. I wasn&#x2019;t easily intimidated in a game, so even when I stuttered, I was always the kid who said, &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; <br>Who&#x2019;s going to take the last shot? &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; We need a touchdown now. &#x201c;Give me the ball.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d be eight years old, usually the smallest guy on the field, but I wanted the ball. And they gave it to me. <br>When I was ten, we moved from the Scranton neighborhood I knew so well to Wilmington, Delaware. My dad was having trouble finding a good job in Scranton, and his brother Frank kept telling him there were jobs in Wilmington. The Biden brothers had spent most of their school days in Wilmington, so it was like going home for my dad. For the rest of us, it felt like leaving home. But my mom, who was born and raised in Scranton, determined to see it as my dad did; she refused to see it any other way. This was a wonderful opportunity. We&#x2019;d have a fresh start. We&#x2019;d make new friends. We were moving into a brand-new neighborhood, to a brand-new home. This wasn&#x2019;t a hand-me-down house. We&#x2019;d be the first people to ever set foot in it. It was all good. She was like that with my stutter, too. She wouldn&#x2019;t dwell on the bad stuff. Joey, you&#x2019;re so handsome. Joey, you&#x2019;re such a good athlete. Joey, you&#x2019;ve got such a high IQ. You&#x2019;ve got so much to say, honey, that your brain gets ahead of you. And if the other kids made fun of me, well, that was their problem. They&#x2019;re just jealous. <br>She knew how wounding kids could be. One thing she determined to do when we moved to Wilmington was hold me back a year. Besides being young and small, I&#x2019;d missed a lot of school the last year in Scranton when I&#x2019;d had my tonsils and adenoids removed. So when we got to Wilmington, my mom insisted I do third grade over&#x2014;and none of the kids at Holy Rosary had to know I was being held back by my mom. That was just another of the ways Wilmington would be a fresh start. <br>Actually, we were moving to the outskirts of Wilmington, to a working-class neighborhood called the Claymont area, just across the Pennsylvania state line. I still remember the drive into Delaware. It all felt like an adventure. My dad was at the wheel and my mom was up front with him, with the three of us kids in back: me, my brother, Jimmy, and my six-year-old sister, Valerie, who was also my best friend. We drove across the state line on the Philadelphia Turnpike, past the Worth Steel Mill, the General Chemical Company, and the oil refineries, all spewing smoke. We drove past Worthland and Overlook Colony, tightly packed with the row houses that the mills had built for their workers not long after the turn of the century. Worthland was full of Italians and Poles; Overlook Colony was black. It was just a mile or so down the road to Brookview Apartments and our brand-new garden unit. A right off the Philadelphia Pike, and we were home. <br>Brookview was a moonscape. A huge water tower loomed over the development, but there wasn&#x2019;t a tree in sight. We followed the main road in as it swept us in a gentle curve. Off the main road were the &#x201c;courts.&#x201d; One side was built, but the other was still under construction. We could see the heavy machinery idling among the mounds of dirt and red clay. It was a hot summer day, so our car windows were rolled down. I can still remember the smell of that red clay, the sulfurous stink from the bowels of the earth. As we arced down the main street toward a new home, my mom caught sight of these airless little one-story apartments. They were the color of brown mustard. My dad must have seen my mom&#x2019;s face as she scanned her new neighborhood. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Pudd&#x2019;,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not these. We have a big one.&#x201d; <br>He pulled the car around to the bottom of a bend, and without getting out of the car, he pointed across an expanse of not-quite lawn, toward the big one. Our new home was a two-story unit, white, with thin columns in front&#x2014;a hint of Tara, I guess&#x2014;and a one-story box off each side. &#x201c;There it is,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;All of this?&#x201d; Mom asked. <br>&#x201c;No, just the center,&#x201d; my dad said. Then, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Pudd&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s only temporary.&#x201d; <br>From the backseat I could tell my mom was crying.<br> &#x201c;Mom!? What&#x2019;s the matter, Mommy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just so happy. Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful? Isn&#x2019;t it beautiful?&#x201d; <br><br>Actually, it didn&#x2019;t seem bad to me. It was a miniature version of a center hall colonial, and we had bedrooms upstairs. I had the bedroom in back, which meant from my window I could gaze upon the object of my deepest desire, my Oz: Archmere. Right in the middle of this working-class steel town, not a mile from the mills and directly across from the entrance of Brookview Apartments, was the first mansion I had ever really seen. I could look at it for hours. John Jacob Raskob had built the house for his family before the steel mills, chemical plants, and oil refineries came to Claymont. Raskob was Pierre du Pont&#x2019;s personal secretary, but he had a genius for making money out of money. He convinced the du Ponts to take a big stake in General Motors and became its chairman of finance. Raskob was also a Catholic hero. He used part of his fortune to fund a charitable foundation, and he&#x2019;d run the campaign of the first Catholic presidential nominee, the Democrat Al Smith. In 1928 the Democrats had political strategy sessions in his library at Archmere. Raskob went on to build the Empire State Building. <br>The mansion he built in Claymont, the Patio at Archmere, was a magnificent Italianate marble pile on a property that sloped down to the Delaware River. Archmere&#x2014;arch by the sea&#x2014;was named for the arch of elms that ran on that slope to the river. But after the working man&#x2019;s families, not to mention the noise and pollution from the mills, began to crowd the Patio, Raskob cut his losses and sold the mansion to an order of Catholic priests. The Norbertines turned it into a private boys&#x2019; school. Archmere Academy was just twenty years old when I moved in across the street. <br>When I played CYO football that year, our coach was Dr. Anzelotti, a Ph.D. chemist at DuPont who had sons at the school. Archmere let Dr. Anzelotti run our practices on the grounds of the school. From the moment I got within the ten-foot-high wrought-iron fence that surrounded the campus and drove up the road&#x2014;they actually called it the yellow-brick road&#x2014;I knew where I wanted to go to high school. I didn&#x2019;t ever think of Archmere as a path to greater glory. When I was ten, getting to Archmere seemed enough. I&#x2019;d sit and stare out my bedroom window and dream of the day I would walk through the front doors and take my spot in that seat of learning. I&#x2019;d dream of the day I would score the touchdown or hit the game-winning home run.<br><br>I entered third grade at Holy Rosary, a Catholic school half a mile down the Philadelphia Pike where the Sisters of Saint Joseph eased me into my new world. They were the link between Scranton and Claymont. Wherever there were nuns, there was home. I&#x2019;m as much a cultural Catholic as I am a theological Catholic. My idea of self, of family, of community, of the wider world comes straight from my religion. It&#x2019;s not so much the Bible, the beatitudes, the Ten Commandments, the sacraments, or the prayers I learned. It&#x2019;s the culture. The nuns are one of the reasons I&#x2019;m still a practicing Catholic. Last summer in Dubuque, Iowa, a local political ally, Teri Goodmann, took me to the Saint Francis Convent&#x2014;a beautiful old building that looked like it belonged on an Ivy League campus. On the way over we&#x2019;d stopped by the Hy-Vee to buy some ice cream for the sisters, because Jean Finnegan Biden&#x2019;s son does not visit nuns empty-handed. It reminded me of grade school, of the last day before the holidays when all my classmates would be presenting their little Christmas offerings to the nun. The desk would be a mound of little specialty soaps. (What else do you get a nun?) The sisters smelled like lavender the rest of the year. I don&#x2019;t remember a nun not smelling like lavender. <br>So I walked into the Dubuque convent with several gallons of ice cream and immediately began to worry we hadn&#x2019;t brought enough. Teri was expecting ten or twelve of the sisters to show up for the event, but there must have been four dozen nuns&#x2014;many of them from the generation that taught me as a boy&#x2014;sitting in a community room. I was there to give a talk about the situation in Iraq, and the sisters really wanted to understand the sectarian conflict there. They peppered me with questions about the Sunnis, the Shi&#x2019;ites, and the Kurds. They wanted to know about the history of the religion the Kurds practice, and they wanted to know how I educated myself about the concerns of the Iraqi people. Many of these nuns had been teachers; knowledge mattered most. We also talked about our own church, then about women&#x2019;s issues, education, and national security. Whether they agreed with my public positions or not, they all smiled at me. Even after we opened up the ice cream, they kept asking questions. And as I was getting ready to leave Teri asked if the sisters would, in the days ahead, pray for Joe Biden&#x2019;s success in his public journey. But they did more than that. The sisters formed a circle around me, raised their arms up over my head, and started singing the blessing they give to one of their own who is going off to do God&#x2019;s work in the next place. &#x201c;May God bless you and keep you.&#x201d; The sisters were so sweet and so genuine that it made me feel the way I did when I was a kid, like I was in touch with something bigger than me. It wasn&#x2019;t any epiphany, wasn&#x2019;t any altar call. It was where I&#x2019;ve always been. The Sisters of Saint Francis in Dubuque, Iowa, were taking me home. <br>The nuns were my first teachers. At Holy Rosary, like at Saint Paul&#x2019;s in Scranton, they taught reading and writing and math and geography and history, but embedded in the curriculum also were the concepts of decency, fair play, and virtue. They took as a starting point the biblical exhortation that man has no greater love than to lay down his life for another man; in school we were about ten clicks back from that. You didn&#x2019;t give your life, but it was noble to help a lady across the street. It was noble to offer a hand up to somebody who had less. It was noble to step in when the bully was picking on somebody. It was noble to intervene.</p><h2>Cookie Shots: Over 30 Exciting Edible Shot Recipes</h2><p>Cookie Shots showcases a collection of edible bite-sized treats.

Brooks attended the University of Rochester and, after graduation, worked for the American Red Cross and the Woodrow Wilson Foundation. He became associate editor of Outlook in 1928 and subsequently was a staff writer for several magazines, including The New Yorker. The short stories he began writing at this time were published in The Saturday Evening Post, Atlantic Monthly, and Esquire. Brooks's short story "Ed Takes the Pledge" was the basis for the 1950s television series Mr. Ed, but his most lasting achievement is the Freddy the Pig series, which began in 1928 with To and Again (Freddy Goes to Florida).

Written because a young fan asked, &#34;What happened to Frightful?&#34; this volume tells how Sam Gribley&#39;s peregrine falcon--that&#39;s Frightful--has to make her own way in the world after Sam is forced to release her. Although told in the third person, the story is developed entirely from the bird&#39;s point of view. George&#39;s narrative follows the falcon through a series of dangerous adventures (involving DDT, electricity lines, and unscrupulous bird traders, to name a few) as she learns to depend on her own instincts. The environmental message is slightly heavy-handed, but it&#39;s wrapped in an enjoyable story from a much loved and astoundingly prolific author. You don&#39;t need to have read the earlier books to make sense of this one, though it may help.

Gracq&#x2019;s poetics is founded upon the basic acts of reading and writing and on the relationship between the writer and his language.<br>&nbsp;<br>This first English-language edition of <i>En lisant en ï¿½crivant</i> will mark a turning point in the public reception of Julien Gracq.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Julien Gracq (1910-2007), born Louis Poirier in Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, was one of the greatest French writers of the twentieth century. His work included essays, criticism, fiction and journalism. He won but refused the Prix Goncourt in 1951 for his novel <i>Le Rivage des Syrtes</i> (<i>The Opposing Shore</i>). This retiring and misunderstood figure said he wrote "to settle a score with expression itself, to give form, stability, precision to things that are vague in the mind."Greatly respected for his early novels and criticism, Gracq seems to have done his utmost to eschew conventional acclaim. He refused the Prix Goncourt in 1951, published little, and, now in his mid-nineties, lives in the small Loire town where he was born. This volume, published in France in 1980, is a series of thoughts on literary matters loosely grouped under subject headings. Many entries are no more than a few lines long, but Gracq's highly personal style and his wide and thoughtful reading make for memorable observations&#x2014;Celine is "a man who started marching behind his own bugle." The book is an engaging antidote to what Gracq sees as a problem with literary criticism: "A book that has seduced me is like a woman who places me under her spell: to hell with her ancestors, birthplace, background, relationships, education, and childhood friends!" <br>Copyright ï¿½ 2006 <i>Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker</i></p><h2>The Power of Praying Together Prayer Cards</h2><p><p>Stormie Omartianï¿½ s previous books have centered on individual prayer that lifts up spouses, children, national needs, and personal growth.

To be sure, there are foundational doctrines that Christians have always considered essential to the faith. But somehow the things considered essential have grown from a few sentences to a long list of theological tenets, many of which were unknown to the early Christians. <br><br> In the beginning, Christians understood that the essence of Christianity was an obedient love-faith relationship with Jesus Christ. This was not just any relationship, but a relationship that produced genuine kingdom fruit. <br><br> But then something happened: Theologians took over the church. Once they took over, the emphasis soon changed from godly fruit to orthodox theology. Christianity became Doctrianity. In this provocative work, Bercot argues that it is time to let Jesus speak through the pages of the Gospels without filtering His teachings through the denials and mental gymnastics of the theologians. It is time for the children of the kingdom to stand up for Jesus and the gospel He preached and for the theologians to sit down.</p><p>Imagine a sizable group of neighborhood bullies gathered in the shadows of a dark alley, just hanging out and practicing their aim by throwing big rocks at an empty dumpster. Bang! Crash! <br><br> The neighbors are irked, but none dare stick their heads out the window to tell the troublemakers to be respectable and let everyone rest in peace. No, those bullies would probably chuck a rock or two at the window from where the voice came. <br><br> Suddenly, a squat, slightly balding old man steps into the alley. Sizing up the situation, he calmly walks up to the gang of bullies, and with a firm but calm voice, commands them: "Sit down, boys! You need to learn a few things." <br><br> The daunting courage of the old man throws them off guard for a few seconds, but on recovering they look at each other with quirky smiles. One of them takes a step forward and blurts out, "And just who do you think you are to tell us what... " <br><br> His voice abruptly breaks off as the old man grabs him by the shoulders, picks him off his feet, and sits him down with a plop on the pavement. Thoroughly shaken by the strange turn of events, the rest of the bullies stare blankly. But the old man is not through. "Did you hear me? I said sit down!" <br><br> When their obedience still does not manifest itself promptly, the invader calmly grabs another punk and repeats his former actions. Realizing by now that the old man means business, the rest meekly take their seats. <br><br> Meet David Bercot, the brave old man who sits the bullies down in his latest book aptly entitled <i> Will the Theologians Please Sit Down. </i> <br><br> Bercot actually entitles one of the chapters Learning to Stand Up to Theological Bullies. Bercot writes with a righteous passion that springs from a deep love for the children of the kingdom. <br><br> Do you grasp now what I said about Bercot being the brave old man: ? How many folks will stand up to such big-name theologians as Augustine, Luther, and Calvin? How many will walk up to them and say calmly but firmly, Will you please sit down? Inferring, of course and be quiet. <br><br> Perhaps you may be wondering, If Bercot seems so intent on tearing down popular theology, just what theology is he promoting? Actually, if you are looking for a book that expounds correct Christian theology, this one will be a disappointment to you. While the author does bring out a few examples of false theology and poor hermeneutics, he really doesn t seem intent on making you believe this or that. His point is ... well, let me say it this way: <br><br> Imagine Jesus sitting on a Galilean hillside, amidst a group of noisy theologians disputing about correct soteriology. David Bercot enters the scene, and begins to ask all the theologians to just sit down. After asking them to or making them take a seat, he does not step up on a rock to set everyone straight on the proper view of salvation. Instead, he also meekly takes a seat at the feet of the Teacher. <br><br> The Teacher, once the group has quieted down, begin His class by saying, "Welcome to Soteriology 101. Today we are going to do a thorough review as to how a person gets saved." <br><br> Then, rising to His feet, the Teacher looks around at the students and say, Follow Me. With that, He turns on His heels and walks away, heading for the closest village to spend the day visiting the sick, speaking kind words to the weary, visiting those in prison, and offering hope to the downtrodden. <br><br> If the above scene rings true to you and a Hallelujah! erupts from your soul, <i>Will the Theologians Please Sit Down </i> will be a fresh breath of air for you. --<i> The Heartbeat of the Remnant </i> magazine, Jan.-Feb., 2010</p><h2>Nonconformity: Writing on Writing</h2><p>The struggle to write with deep emotion is the subject of this extraordinary book, the previously unpublished credo of one of America's greatest 20th-century writers.<br>"You don't write a novel out of sheer pity any more than you blow a safe out of a vague longing to be rich," writes Nelson Algren in his only longer work of nonfiction, adding: "A certain ruthlessness and a sense of alienation from society is as essential to creative writing as it is to armed robbery."<br>Nonconformity is about 20th-century America: "Never on the earth of man has he lived so tidily as here amidst such psychological disorder." And it is about the trouble writers ask for when they try to describe America: "Our myths are so many, our vision so dim, our self-deception so deep and our smugness so gross that scarcely any way now remains of reporting the American Century except from behind the billboards . . . [where there] are still . . . defeats in which everything is lost [and] victories that fall close enough to the heart to afford living hope."<br>In Nonconformity, Algren identifies the essential nature of the writer's relation to society, drawing examples from Dostoyevsky, Chekhov, Twain, and Fitzgerald, as well as utility infielder Leo Durocher and legendary barkeep Martin Dooley. He shares his deepest beliefs about the state of literature and its role in society, along the way painting a chilling portrait of the early 1950s, Joe McCarthy's heyday, when many American writers were blacklisted and ruined for saying similar things to what Algren is saying here.</p><p>During the McCarthy era, writer Nelson Algren was fingered as a Communist. The author of hugely successful novels including The Man with the Golden Arm and A Walk on the Wild Side, Algren lost a contract with his publisher, Doubleday, for a book of essays. The manuscript for those essays had been missing for nearly four decades. But publisher Daniel Simon has resurrected the work, a collection of diatribes and rants on the life and philosophy of the modern writer. The book reflects the depth of Algren&#39;s sensitivity, which was at odds with the tough-guy image he tried to present.<p>One of the most neglected of modern American authors and also one of the best loved, <b>NELSON ALGREN</b> (1909&#x2013;1981) believed that &#x201c;literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.&#x201d; His own voluminous body of work stands up to that belief. Algren&#x2019;s powerful voice rose from the urban wilderness of postwar Chicago, and it is to that city of hustlers, addicts and scamps that he returned again and again, eventually raising Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;lower depths&#x201d; up onto a stage for the whole world to behold. Recipient of the first National Book Award for fiction and lauded by Hemingway as &#x201c;one of the two best authors in America,&#x201d; Algren remains among our most defiant and enduring novelists. His work includes five major novels, two short fiction collections, a book-length poem and several collections of reportage. A source of inspiration to artists as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme, Studs Terkel and Lou Reed, Algren died on May 9, 1981, within days of his appointment as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p></p><h2>The Empire of Glass (Doctor Who - The Missing Adventures Series)</h2><p>&#34;There is a old Venetian saying,&#34; the Doctor murmured. &#34;The council of ten send you to the torture chamber; the council of three send you to the grave.&#34; A strange invitation brings the Doctor, Steven and Vicki to Venice in the year of our Lord 1609: a place of politics and poison, science and superstition, telescopes and terror.

A paean to patience? Hardly, maintains Safire, who interprets Job's central lesson to be that we are morally obligated to defy unjust authority and to hold those in power accountable. The New York Times columnist celebrates Malcolm X, Andrei Sakharov and Menachem Begin as dissenters of Joban stature. With mixed success, he draws on the lessons of the biblical tale in order to critique President Bush's failure to topple Saddam Hussein, Bill Clinton's political career and the doings of Pat Buchanan, Richard Nixon, John F. Kennedy and others. Safire movingly portrays Abraham Lincoln as "our most Joban president," one who refused to compromise his principles. His conversationally written gloss sets forth guidelines for how to pursue a "Joban life" by refusing to accept injustice from any quarter. An appendix reprints the Book of Job.

Many returned home with stories of distant lands and at least some of the objects they collected during their journeys. And those who did not travel eagerly acquired wondrous materials that arrived from faraway places. Objects traveled various routes&#x2014;personal, imperial, missionary, or trade&#x2014;and moved not only across space but also across cultures.</p><p>Histories of the early modern global culture of collecting have focused for the most part on European <i>Wunderkammern</i>, or "cabinets of curiosities." But the passion for acquiring unfamiliar items rippled across many lands. The court in Java marveled at, collected, and displayed myriad goods brought through its halls. African princes traded captured members of other African groups so they could get the newest kinds of cloth produced in Europe. Native Americans sought colored glass beads made in Europe, often trading them to other indigenous groups. Items changed hands and crossed cultural boundaries frequently, often gaining new and valuable meanings in the process. An object that might have seemed mundane in some cultures could become a target of veneration in another.</p><p>The fourteen essays in <i>Collecting Across Cultures</i> represent work by an international group of historians, art historians, and historians of science. Each author explores a specific aspect of the cross-cultural history of collecting and display from the dawn of the sixteenth century to the early decades of the nineteenth century. As the essays attest, an examination of early modern collecting in cross-cultural contexts sheds light on the creative and complicated ways in which objects in collections served to create knowledge&#x2014;some factual, some fictional&#x2014;about distant peoples in an increasingly transnational world.</p></p><p>Daniela Bleichmar is Associate Professor of Art History and History at the University of Southern California.

Like Christopher Columbus and other Europeans who had arrived in the Americas after 1492, Cortï¿½s knew it was important to record what he saw. In his case, he wrote a series of letters to King Charles V, the sponsor of his mission. In the course of that report, he mentioned that he had had a tour of some of Emperor Moctezuma's many properties in the great city of Tenochtitlan. One in particular struck him: a menagerie filled with birds and mammals, one more incredible than the next. The conquistador might not have realized it, but back in Europe, Pope Leo X had also assembled a group of beasts, which he housed at the Vatican. One of his most treasured creatures was an elephant, whose entry into Rome had been such a sensation that thousands of people flocked to see its transit into the home of the Church.</p><p>The Holy See and the man who would soon fall victim to the unholy conqueror of Mexico shared more than a love of animals. The creatures in their dwellings were not pets in the modern sense of the word. They were specimens in living collections, brought together in an age when peoples across the Atlantic basin&#x2014;and far beyond&#x2014;avidly tried to amass and display physical objects or their visual representations. Well aware of the importance of collections and of the special interest that New World objects held for European viewers, Cortï¿½s sent gold and silver artifacts, gems, and striking featherwork back to Spain. These American collectibles, which impressed Charles and audiences throughout Europe, served as material evidence to demonstrate the Spanish king's authority, as well as Cortï¿½s's work on behalf of his patron. Soon, New World objects stood or hung side by side with artifacts from Asia, Africa, and the Old World in European cabinets of curiosities. Those who spent endless energies and vast fortunes to bring exotica into rooms or cages acted out the acquisitive impulses that lay at the heart of what one historian aptly called ''the age of mutual discovery.'' They also initiated a process that would permanently alter global cultures.</p><p>The modern museum has its roots in the early modern era. Between the sixteenth and the eighteenth century, it grew from its origins as the Wunderkammer or ''cabinet of curiosities,'' the private possession of an individual (most often a wealthy elite owner), toward a public institution. The rise of the collection in the early modern age reflected some of the central developments of the period: the rediscovery of classical antiquity and the discovery of the New World; European exploration and colonial expansion; global exchanges through trade, colonization, and missionary activity; the political and religious reorganization of Europe; and the redefinition and reinvention of the identity of both science and art, as well as the relationship between the two. To study the history of early modern collecting is to engage with the larger historical questions and narratives of the period.</p><p>Early modern collecting was closely related to the cross-cultural travels of people and things. Since the mid-fourteenth century, more people had traveled farther than ever before, and they typically returned home with stories to tell about distant lands and at least some of the wares they acquired there. Elites eagerly tried to gain possession of the most dramatic or remarkable goods. Yet as the passion for collecting rippled across many lands, there was no single individual or group who determined what all collections might contain. Many Europeans played crucial roles, especially those who sponsored collecting missions. But there were Native American collectors too, and Asian and African, and all of them sought to acquire and often display the rarities that their power or wealth enabled them to acquire. African princes traded captured members of other African groups so they could get the newest kinds of cloth produced in Europe. Goods from the Old World changed hands repeatedly in the Western Hemisphere when one group after another tried to gain access to novel items. Chinese porcelain had a prized place in European palaces as well as humbler homes, and its arrival led not only to the birth of the European porcelain industry in the eighteenth century but also to the development of new types of blue and white ceramics in Europe and the Americas. The court in Java marveled at the goods brought through its halls. The Siamese greeted the arrival of European material objects with joy. Native Americans sought colored glass beads made in Europe, often trading them to other groups. Items crossed cultures, gaining new value and meanings in the process. Human beings&#x2014;living Africans, the skeletons of Americans&#x2014;found their way into collections too, suggesting that their bodies were as worthy of contemplation and study as the alligator suspended in the Portal of the Lizard in the cathedral in Seville or the Brazilian capybaras featured so prominently in Dutch paintings. Exoticism and its many meanings collided with the scholarly and religious impulses of the European Renaissance and the Enlightenment.</p></p><h2>Green Nature/Human Nature: THE MEANING OF PLANTS IN OUR LIVES (Environment Human Condition)</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Why are our spirits lifted by flowers, our feelings of tension allayed by a walk in forest or park? What other positive influences can nature have on humanity? <p>In Green Nature/Human Nature, Charles A. Lewis describes the psychological, sociological and physiological responses of people to vegetation in cities and forests, as well as in horticultural therapy programs in hospitals, geriatric institutions, physical rehabilittion centers, drug rehabilitation programs and correctional institutions. He presents an evolutionary basis for the human attraction to plants. People-plant interactions are presented from two perspectives: participatory, in which the individual is involved in planting and maintaining the vegetation, and observational, in which the individual bears no responsibility for establishing or maintaining the vegetation. </p><p>In what amounts to a straighforward catalog of well-documented and tangible benefits, Lewis brings the latest and best research into plant/human interaction to bear on questions of how green nature is intertwined with the human psyche and how that interaction can lead to enhanced well-being and an appreciation of the human dimension in environmental concerns. </p><p>Lewis's work will be essential reading for anyone interested in plants and how they affect people.</p>Charles A. Lewis was graduated from the University of Maryland, received his MS from Cornell University and has worked as a plant breeder, garden center operator, and director of the former Sterling Forest Gardens in Tuxedo, New York. He was Horticulturist, Administrator of Collections, and Research Fellow at the Morton Arboretun in Lisle, Illinois. His work in people/plant interactions has been honored by such organizations as the American Horticulture Society, American Horticultural Therapy Association, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Swarthmore College, American Association of Botanical Garden and Arboreta, New York City Housing Authority, Chicago housing Authority and the People Plant Council. He now lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico and consults on people/plant interactions. He has published widely in professional journals and popular magazines and newspapers.</p><h2>That Deadman Dance: A Novel</h2><p><p>Set in Western Australia in the first decades of the nineteenth century, That Deadman Dance is a vast, gorgeous novel about the first contact between the Aboriginal Noongar people and the new European settlers.</p><p>Bobby Wabalanginy is a young Noongar man, smart, resourceful, and eager to please. He befriends the European arrivals, joining them as they hunt whales, till the land, and establish their new colony. He is welcomed into a prosperous white family, and eventually finds himself falling in love with the daughter, Christine. But slowly-by design and by hazard-things begin to change. Not everyone is happy with how the colony is progressing. Livestock mysteriously start to disappear, crops are destroyed, there are "accidents" and injuries on both sides. As the Europeans impose ever-stricter rules and regulations in order to keep the peace, Bobby's Elders decide they must respond in kind, and Bobby is forced to take sides, inexorably drawn into a series of events that will forever change the future of his country.</p><p><i>That Deadman Dance</i> is inevitably tragic, as most stories of European and native contact are. But through Bobby's life, Kim Scott exuberantly explores a moment in time when things could have been different, when black and white lived together in amazement rather than fear of the other, and when the world seemed suddenly twice as large and twice as promising. At once celebratory and heartbreaking, this novel is a unique and important contribution to the literature of native experience.</p></p><p><p><b>Kim Scott</b> was born in 1957 to a white mother and Aboriginal father. His first novel, <i>True Country</i>, was published in 1993. His second, <i>Benang: From the Heart, </i>won the 2000 Miles Franklin Award and the Western Australia Premier's Book Award. He has also published short stories and poetry.

Combining cutting edge scientific theory with grand romantic adventure, this series represents space opera at its finest.<br><i>The Final Key</i> is the second half of the story arc known as <i>Triad</i>, which began in <i>Schism</i>. <i>Schism</i> ended with the Skolian Empire torn asunder by personal conflict within the royal family. With <i>The Final Key</i>, the Skolian Empire comes under all-out assault from its nemesis, the Euban Concord, who have undermined the Empire via subterfuge and assassination, leaving it ripe for conquest. The Skolian Empire's only hope? A young woman barely out of her teens who hasn't even complete her training as a cadet.</p><p>CATHERINE ASARO received a doctorate in physics from Harvard University, has published a number of papers on theoretical physics and was a physics professor until 1990, when she established Molecudyne Research. A former ballerina, she has performed with ballets and in musicals on both coasts. She lives with her husband and daughter in Columbia, Maryland.Given the complex world within Asaro's Skolian Empire saga, perhaps it's forgivable that the first third of her second Triad fantasy (after 2004's <i>Schism</i>) explains at tedious length the history of the Ruby Dynasty, a ruling tribe of telepaths who struggle with discord among themselves even as they fight off their dire enemies, the Euban Concord. Readers of this extensive chronicle will happily plunge back into the fray, but newcomers might stumble, feeling much like first-time viewers of a byzantine space soap opera. However, once the action heats up with an assassination attempt that disables the head of the Ruby Dynasty, rapid pacing and gripping suspense whisks away any confusion. Young Soz, an heir to the throne and a military cadet, seizes the book's spotlight with her combination of vulnerability and bravery as she steps up to responsibility. But with so many characters, this tale suffers from a lack of focus. Asaro's saga is a monumental work, but only a more careful honing of the individual novels will make the series masterful. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

S. Lewis, and the founder of the Marion E. Wade Center at Wheaton College, IL, for the study of the works of Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and other members of the Inklings<i>. </i>Less known is that Dr. Kilby was also an apologist in his time for arts, aesthetics and beauty, particularly among Evangelicals.<br><br> This collection offers a sampler of the work of Dr. Clyde Kilby on these themes. He writes reflections under four headings: &#x201c;Christianity, Art, and Aesthetics&#x201d;; &#x201c;The Vocation of the Artist&#x201d;;&nbsp;&#x201c;Faith and the Role of the Imagination&#x201d;; and &#x201c;Poetry, Literature and the&nbsp;Imagination.&#x201d;<br><br> With a unique voice, Kilby writes from a specific literary and philosophical context that relates&nbsp;art and aesthetics with beauty, and all that is embodied in the classics. His work is particularly relevant&nbsp;today as these topics are being embraced by Protestants, Evangelicals, and indeed people of faith from many different traditions.&nbsp; A deeply engaging book for readers who want to look more closely at themes of art, aesthetics, beauty and literature in the context of faith.</p><p><b>Clyde Samuel Kilby</b>&nbsp;was an&nbsp;American&nbsp;author and English professor, best known for his scholarship on the&nbsp;<i>Inklings</i>, especially&nbsp;J.

Wade Center there, making it a center for the study of the <i>Inklings</i> and their literary companions.&#x201c;Samuel Johnson said people need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed. Dr. Kilby reminds us of what it means to be made in the image of God and how art, in our creation and reception of it, illuminates, articulates and glorifies that original great mimesis. With wisdom and relevance, this collection provides a touchstone for the spiritual thinker in its reconciliation of art&#x2019;s true and beautiful purpose with the unspeakable, inimitable mystery of God.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Dr. Carolyn Weber, </b>author of <i>Surprised by Oxford</i> and<i> Holy is the Day</i><br><br> &#x201c;<i>The Arts and the Christian Imagination</i>&nbsp;is a landmark book.&nbsp;Its scope is breathtaking, bringing together in one place well-known &#x2018;signature&#x2019; essays by Clyde Kilby and unknown but equally excellent ones.

Such breadth strengthens Kilby&#x2019;s call for evangelical Christians to take the arts more seriously. He returns repeatedly to two concepts: metaphor&#x2019;s importance to aesthetics, and the centrality of the imagination for the individual and for Christianity.... Taken as a whole, Kilby&#x2019;s writings are jarring for the contemporary reader accustomed to relativism. Kilby is confident that truth exists and that we can go some way in finding it, starting from our acceptance of the Gospel. From this foundation, we set out into an expanded world. That journey needs to include the aesthetic in all its forms. Be bold, he tells us.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Brian Welter,</b> New Oxford Review</p><h2>Laughing Boy</h2><p>A young Navaho couple watches their relationship and their way of life crumble under the influence of white American society as they struggle to protect their traditional beliefs and love. Winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Reissue.</p><p>OLIVER LA FARGE (1901-1963) first traveled to Navajo territory on a Harvard archaeological dig. Laughing Boy was his first novel.I<br><br> He was riding the hundred miles from T&#x2019;o Tlakai to Tsï¿½ Lani to attend a dance, or rather, for the horse-racing that would come afterwards. The sun was hot and his belly was empty, but life moved in rhythm with his pony loping steadily as an engine down the miles. He was lax in the saddle, leaning back, arm swinging the rope&#x2019;s end in time to the horse&#x2019;s lope. His new red headband was a bright colour among the embers of the sun-struck desert, undulating like a moving graph of the pony&#x2019;s lope, or the music of his song <br><br> Nashdui bik&#x2019;ï¿½ dinni, eya-a, eyo-o . . . Wildcat&#x2019;s feet hurt, eya-a, eyo-o . . .&#x2019;<br><br> Rope&#x2019;s end, shoulders, song, all moved together, and life flowed in one stream. He threw his head back to sing louder, and listened to the echo from the cliffs on his right. He was thinking about a bracelet he should make, with four smooth bars running together, and a turquoise in the middle if he could get the silver. He wished he could work while riding; everything was so perfect then, like the prayers, hozoji nashad, travelling in beauty. His hands, his feet, his head, his insides all were hozoji, all were very much alive. He whooped and struck up the Magpie Song till the empty desert resounded <br><br> A-a-a-inï¿½, a-a-a-inï¿½, Ya-a-inï¿½-ainï¿½, ko-ya-ainï¿½ . . .&#x2019;<br><br> He was lean, slender, tall, and handsome, Laughing Boy, with a new cheap headband and a borrowed silver belt to make ragged clothes look fine. At noon, having no money, he begged coffee from a trader at Chinlee and went on, treasuring his hunger because of the feasting to come. Now he began to meet Navajos of all ages, riding to the dance. The young men bunched together a line of jingling bridles, dark, excited faces, flashing silver, turquoise, velveteen shirts, dirty, ragged overalls, a pair of plaid calico leggins, a pair of turkey-red ones. Some of them were heavy with jewelry; Horse Giver&#x2019;s Son wore over four hundred dollars in silver alone; most of them had more than Laughing Boy. They stopped to look at his bow-guard, which he himself had made. I am a good jeweller,&#x2019; he said, elated; I make silver run like a song.&#x2019; You should make a song about yourself,&#x2019; they told him, and teach the burros to sing it.&#x2019; Have you had any rain up by T&#x2019;o Tlakai?&#x2019; No, it is just like last year. It is the devil. The grass is all dried up and the sheep are dying.&#x2019; They had a cloudburst over by T&#x2019;isya Lani. It washed out the dam.&#x2019; It washed out the missionary&#x2019;s house, they say. His wife ran out in something thin and got wet, they say.&#x2019; Ei-yei!&#x2019; Tall Hunter and his wife drove past in a brand-new buckboard behind two fast-trotting, grey mules. He owned over five hundred head of horses, and his wife had thick strings of turquoise and coral around her neck. His brother is in jail for stealing cattle, they say.&#x2019; What is jail?&#x2019; asked Laughing Boy. Slender Hair explained: It is something the American Chief does to you. He puts you in a room of stone, like a Moqui house, only it is dark and you can&#x2019;t get out. People die there, they say. They haven&#x2019;t any room; they can&#x2019;t see anything, they say. I do not like to talk about it.&#x2019; Laughing Boy thought, I should rather die. He wanted to ask more, but was ashamed to show his ignorance before these southern Navajos, many of whom wore hats like Americans, and who knew so much of Americans&#x2019; ways. They raced. His horse was tired, but it won by a nose, which was just as well, since he had bet his bow-guard. Now he had six dollars. He hoped there would be gambling. Tsï¿½ Lani showed a distant bonfire in the dusk, with mounted Indians moving in on it like spokes of a wheel. About two hundred young men came together half a mile away, making their ponies prance, exchanging greetings. Crooked Ear carried the ceremonial wand. Now they all lined up, with the dull, red sunset behind their black figures. They started going like getting off to a race, right into a gallop, yelling. Over by the fire was shouting, and another line tearing towards them. The world was full of a roar of hooves and two walls of noise rushing together, the men leaning forward over their horses&#x2019; necks, mouths wide. E-e-e-e-e!&#x2019; They met in a great swirl of plunging, dodging horses, and swept on all together, whooping for dear life, with the staff in front of them, almost onto the fire, then dissolved with jingling of bits, laughter, and casual jokes as they unsaddled by the pool. The steady motion of excitement was slowed then, in the last of the day, by the rocks and the pinons, by the reflection of the sky in the pool where flat, vague silhouettes of horses stooped to drink. The voices of many people, the twinkling of fires continuued the motif, joining the time of quiet with elation past and to come; a little feeling of expectation in Laughing Boy&#x2019;s chest, a joyful emptiness, part hungeeeeer and part excitement. He tended his pony minutely. The little mare had had two days of loping; shortly he wanted to race her; three days of rest would not be too much. She was his only horse; he had traded two others for her. She was tough, as a horse had to be to live at all in the North country. He ran his hands down her withers, feeling the lean, decisive muscles. In all that section, from Dennihuitso to Biltabito, from T&#x2019;o Tlikahn to T&#x2019;o Baka, where he knew every horse by sight, she was the best, but she would meet some competition here. He felt as if she were his own creation, like the bowguard; at least he had selected her, as he had chosen the soft blue turquoise in the ornament. Little, compact, all black save for the tiny white spot on her forehead, she had the ugly Roman nose of character. She was like an arrow notched to a taut bowstring a movement of the hand would release level flight swiftly to a mark. He was thinking some of these things, half hearing the noises of the people. Just like the prayer, travelling in beauty.&#x2019; It would be good to be a singer as well, to express all these things through the prayers. He would like to know many of them, to learn to conduct the Mountain Chant, and know all the beautiful stories behind the songs and ceremonies inside the Dark Circle of Branches. That would be really on the trail of beauty; to work in silver and turquoise, own soft-moving ponies, and lead the Mountain Chant. Just thinking about it was good. It made him feel cool inside.<br><br> Hozho hogahn ladin nasha woyen . . . In the house of happiness there I wander . . .&#x2019;<br><br> All the time he was passing his hand along the pony&#x2019;s neck, along her back, feeling the lines of tough muscles. E-ya, Grandfather, are you going to dance with the horse?&#x2019; Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son called over to him, food is ready.&#x2019; Hakone!&#x2019; He returned abruptly to the quick-moving life of the dance. I can eat it. I did not know you were coming.&#x2019; I came when I heard you were to race your mare.

Busy housewives gave them coffee, the big pot of meat was passed over, and a flat, round loaf of rubbery, filling bread. The meat was the backbone of a yearling calf, boiled with corn. It was good. He munched joyfully, feeling his empty stomach fill, wadding himself with bread, washing it down with bitter coffee. A couple of Americans carrying their own plates dipped in gingerly. A Hopi, having collected everything he could possibly eat, sat down officiously beside them to air his school English and his bourgeois superiority.<br><br> II<br><br>A small drum beating rapidly concentrated the mixed noises into a staccato unison. Young men gathered about the drummer. Laughing Boy might have eaten more, but he left the fire immediately with Jesting Squaw&#x2019;s Son. Some one led off high-pitched at full voice,<br><br> Yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana, yo-o galeana . . .&#x2019;<br><br> By the end of the second word the crowd was with him; more young men hurried up to join the diapason,<br><br> Galeana ena, galeana eno, yo-o ay-e hena ena . . .&#x2019;<br><br> They put their arms over each other&#x2019;s shoulders, swaying in time to the one drum that ran like a dull, glowing thread through the singing, four hundred young men turning loose everything they had. A bonfire twenty feet long flared to the left of them. Opposite, and to the right, the older people sat wrapped in their blankets., Behind them, men crouched in their saddles, heads and shoulders against the night sky, nodding time to the rhythm, silent, with here and there a reflection of firelight on a bit of silver, a dark face, or a horse&#x2019;s eye. Twelve girls in single file stole into the open space, moving quietly and aloof as though the uproar of singing were petrified into a protective wall before it reached them. Only the pulse of the drum showed in their steps. They prowled back and forth before the line of young men, considering them with predatory judgment. Laughing Boy at the back of the crowd looked at them with mild interest; he liked to watch their suave movements and the rich display of blankets and jewelry. One caught his attention; he thought she had on more silver, coral, turquoise, and white shell than he had ever seen on any one person. He speculated on its value horses she must have a very rich mother, or uncles. She was too slender, seeming frail to dance in all that rich, heavy ornamentation.

In 1982, property speculation is beginning to be a big, big thing in Dublin--and their street is very much in an up-and-coming part of town. "They laughed and hugged each other. Danny Lynch from the broken-down cottage in the back of beyond and Ria Johnson from the corner house in the big, shabby estate were not only living like gentry in a big Tara Road mansion, they were actually debating what style of dining table to buy." But for its various inhabitants, the street is to become a boulevard of dreams--some broken, others created anew. Maeve Binchy has long proved herself a secure hand at multiple story lines, and over the course of 500 satisfying pages she focuses on Ria; her best friend, Rosemary Ryan, a beautiful, endlessly selfish career woman; Gertie, the battered wife of a drunkard; and several other intriguing women, each of whom has secrets not to be shared. There is even an all-knowing fortune teller who early on hints that Ria will travel and start a successful business--two things she knows are definitely <i>not</i> in the offing. <p> Yet after our supposedly happy housewife and mother of two is confronted by some inexorable home truths, a chance phone call from America will change her life, forcing her to discard her illusions about men, women, and marriage and start all over again. At the same time, the Connecticut caller, Marilyn Vine, has her own lessons to learn when she and Ria swap houses for the summer. Yet there's nothing remotely preachy about this novel--even the bad guys (and yes, they're usually guys) and beautiful mistresses get to maintain some appeal. Instead, <i>Tara Road</i> is a stirring look at the reality behind our consuming fantasies, and a page-turner to boot. <i>--Siobhan Carson</i></p>TARA ROAD is the unforgettable story of two women -- one from Dublin, one from New England -- who exchange houses, and lives, for one fateful summer.

This faux cook book chronicles the special love affair Mormons have with lowbrow eating and provides easy, step-by-step directions for preparation of the likes of bologna mock chicken wings.<p>Sister Christensen illustrates her favorite culinary hints with photographs of herself with her buns in the kitchen and of Brother Christensen at his TV tray wolfing down her delectable delights.

Salazar, a hairdresser, claims to have acquired cherished recipes from his Salt Lake Valley Relief Society clientele, which is how he conjured up &#x201c;Sister Enid Christensen,&#x201d; the alleged co-author of his humorous book, No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret (Not Sacred) Recipes of Sister Enid Christensen.<br><br>Michael G. Wightman, a Salt Lake City music composer (part-time) and house painter (full-time), says he inherited family cookbooks from generations of zucchini-loving progenitors. These, along with his keen sense of humor and natural &#x201c;Mo-look,&#x201d; were invaluable contributions to No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret (Not Sacred) Recipes of Sister Enid Christensen, which he co-authored and for which he posed as &#x201c;Brother Christensen.&#x201d;Roger Salazar emerges from two hours in make-up ready for another book appearance. In his arms is an enormous, multicolored, molded Jell-O. &#34;I never thought I would parlay my theater degree into book promotion,&#34; says Salazar, author of No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret (not Sacred) Recipes of Sister Enid Christensen. In nylons, permed wig, and press-on nails, Salazar has become Sister Enid Christensen, the quintessential Mormon housewife. Elaborating on the spiritual aspects of Jell-O sculpting, Salazar hints that his new cookbook published by Signature Books is a tongue-in-cheek parody of life in Utah. He is quick to brag that he knows hundreds of ways to prepare Jell-o, zucchini, and spam &#34;three prerequisites to any successful suburban Utah meal.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m so proud to come from the Jell-O Belt,&#34; jokes Salazar, &#34;which you may know stretches all the way from Burley, Idaho to Snowflake, Arizona. West Valley City (a suburb of Salt Lake City) is, of course, the Jell-O capital of the world!&#34; Sister Christensen considers her recipes the height of haute cuisine. &#34;These days people are tired of steak and potatoes,&#34; she says. &#34;they crave more sophisticated dishes like casseroles.&#34; She breaks into a husky, contra-alto rendition of &#34;Casserole-serole&#34; to the tune of &#34;Que Sera, Sera.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s time for Martha Stewart to move over,&#34; laughs this self- proclaimed &#39;post-feminist icon,&#39; &#34;because people like me are coming out of the kitchen. It&#39;s the nineties, after all.&#34; No Man Knows My Pastries, with over 100 recipes and 50 photographs, bridges the gap between easy and edible, fast and fashionable. &#34;It liberates housewives and house-husbands from kitchen drudgery, allowing them to focus on basic family values like sitting around the T.V.&#34; She adds, &#34;Fast foods are glorious technological advances brought forth to assist in spreading the good word from the good book. Cooking from scratch leaves little time for church and family.&#34; &#34;At first I was reluctant to share my special recipes,&#34; Sister Christensen explains. &#34;It was not until God told me I was hiding my light under a bushel, and my dear friend Roger promised me advanced royalties, that I agreed to part with my sweet family&#39;s favorite recipes.&#34; Sister Christensen&#39;s creations include such mouthwatering temptations as &#34;Sweet and Sour Spam,&#34; &#34;Fig and Orange Jell-O Mold,&#34; &#34;Sausage Souffle,&#34; &#34;Tomato Soup Cake,&#34; &#34;Processed Cheese Dip,&#34; &#34;Bologna Angel Wings&#34; (for the holidays), &#34;Lumpy Dick&#34; (a dumpling delicacy), and &#34;Irish Postum&#34; (Mormons don&#39;t drink coffee). &#34;There may actually be some recipes in this book that can be used to make something edible,&#34; says Salt Lake Tribune&#39;s book reviewer Paul Swenson, &#34;but mostly it should be kept out of the kitchen.

High in its northern hemisphere floats Niflheim, an island approximately the size and shape of the Scandinavian peninsula on Old Earth. Niflheim is the center of Thorsfinni's World's Viking-based civilization and home to better than three-quarters of its population. In northern Niflheim the summer temperature rarely broaches 25 degrees on the Celsius scale, its winter temperatures often reaching that degree on the minus side of the scale. Niflheim is a wet place, rainy when the temperature is warm enough for liquid precipitation, snowy the rest of the year. And all of Thorsfinni's World smells of fish.<br> <br>Niflheim. Outpost of Human Space. Home of the 34th Fleet Initial Strike Team, Confederation Marine Corps. When the Marines of 34th FIST weren't off on a campaign on some other world, they spent most of their time in the field, either on Niflheim or one of the other islands, training for operations they might not ever be called upon to execute. Even if they trained for something they would never have to do, their commanders felt the most important thing was that they trained.<br> <br>"So that's what we're going to be doing for the next two or three days," Ensign vanden Hoyt said at the conclusion of his briefing to the men of the third platoon, Company L, 34th FIST. A wry smile crossed his <br>lips and he added, "Or what you'll be doing, I should say. Any questions? Problems?" He peered carefully through the steady rain in the direction of the men--his men, his first command. All he could make out were their indistinct faces through what looked like undulating sheets of water. Their heads seemed to hover in the air. Ten years in the Corps and he was still sometimes startled by the illusions created by chameleon field uniforms.<br> <br>There were no questions and only one problem, but it wasn't voiced. Lance Corporal "Hammer" Schultz caught the eye of the platoon sergeant, Charlie Bass, and shook his head slightly. Bass replied with an almost imperceptible head bob. The problem was dealt with.<br> <br>"All right, then," vanden Hoyt said when nobody spoke up, "Staff Sergeant Bass will make the assignments. Then you can get back under shelter until it's time for you to go back into the rain." He stepped aside to let Bass take front and center.<br> <br>"First squad," Bass said without preamble, wanting to get out of the rain as badly as anyone else in the platoon, maybe more so. Twenty-odd years as a Marine had taught him when being uncomfortable was good, and when it wasn't. "Chan, I'm sticking you with MacIlargie and Godenov, so you also get Schultz. Go someplace and dry off," he said, glancing at the low, dark sky, which showed no sign of breaking, and shook his head. "Or at least get out from underwater until you get your assignment. Van Impe, you have Lonsdorf. You also get Neru and Clarke from guns..."<br> <br>Chan and his three men didn't hear the rest of the assignments. As soon as their names were called, Chan gathered his men and they slogged through churning mud for shelter.<br> <br>"You should be in charge here," Chan said to Lance Corporal Schultz. "You're senior to me, and you've got a lot more experience."<br> <br>Schultz grunted. He didn't want to be in charge. He was exactly what he wanted to be, a lance corporal, a man not in command in any way. His function in life, as he saw it, was to be a fighter, not a leader. The Confederation Marine Corps was filled with men well-qualified to be officers and noncommissioned officers, more than there were slots to fill. Schultz was an excellent fighter; so far as the Corps was concerned, he could remain a lance corporal until he retired, if that's what he wanted.<br> <br>Shelter was a low tent made from three polymer sheets stretched over a framework of strong synthetic rods. The four Marines had to crouch to get <br>inside, and almost had to huddle together for all of them to fit. Chan turned on the radiant heating unit that sat in the center of the tent while Schultz secured the entrance. Wind buffeted the tent and the rain drummed on it, making conversation difficult--but at least they had a chance to dry out. The four sat cross-legged around the heater and in minutes their fronts were dried. Then they turned around. Their backs weren't quite dry when the flap opened and Charlie Bass crowded in, extending his open arms toward the heater as he moaned with pleasure.<br> <br> "There used to be a disease called rheumatoid arthritis," he said. "Cold and wet made your joints swell up and hurt. If bioengineering hadn't <br>eradicated it, I'd probably have it and be aching in every joint in my body," he twisted his back to ease rain- and wind-stiffened muscles, <br>"instead of just feeling like I've been turned into a piece of soggy wood." The others chuckled at his joke.<br> <br>"All right," Bass said, abruptly all business. "Mike Company's making a sweep. Third platoon's going to stop them. Here's your part of it ..."<br> <br>This phase of the two-week exercise was a three-way force-on-force for the three companies of the FIST's infantry battalion, with the other units of <br>the FIST in support of all three companies. Kilo and Mike Companies were acting as complete units in opposition to each other. Company L was <br>playing an irregular force, broken down into four-man teams that would act in opposition to Kilo and Mike. Commander Van Winkle, the battalion's <br>commanding officer, wanted to test the junior men, so the officers and NCOs of Company L were acting as umpires, and each four-man team was <br>headed by a lance corporal.<br> <br>A Dragon, the Marines' ubiquitous amphibious armored vehicle, dropped off Chan and his team twenty-five kilometers northeast of the company's <br>bivouac area. In addition to their weapons and simulators, they carried light packs with little more than two days of rations. Due to vagaries of local weather conditions, the sun was shining brightly where the Dragon dropped them off and the rocky ground underfoot was dry; it hadn't even rained overnight there. The team was in a clearing in the midst of sparse vegetation that grew to twice the height of a man. The main plants in the area resembled Earth scrub-pine trees.<br> <br>Chan checked the time. "We don't know how long it'll be before somebody gets here," he said, "or if it's going to be a platoon or a whole company or anything else. We need to find a position where we can watch all approaches from under cover." He scanned the area as he spoke, orienting himself, looking for recognizable landmarks, building a mental map of the unfamiliar scene.<br> <br>Nothing that resembled grass grew on the rocks under the pine tree look-alikes, just a spotty coating of pale green, lichenlike stuff. Spindly plants whose stems didn't look strong enough to hold themselves upright grew from cracks in the forest floor. Flitterers that could have been butterflylike birds, or birdlike butterflies, flew from tree to tree. Smaller buzzers that could easily have been mistaken for Earth insects by anyone but an entomologist zigged and zagged their way among the lower flora of the forest, stopping here and there to absorb whatever passed for nectar on Thorsfinni's World.<br> <br>Chan looked to Schultz for help.<br> <br> Schultz merely shrugged and said, "You're in charge," which was no help at all.<br> <br>This wasn't realistic, Chan thought. Irregulars should know the area <br>they were in, and he'd never been there before. Maps didn't tell you what <br>was really there. After a moment, he said, "That tor over there," pointing <br>toward a low hill barely visible through the trees to the northwest. "That <br>seems to be the highest ground around. That's probably our best starting <br>place. If nothing else, we can take a look around from there." He looked <br>at his men as he talked. Schultz was walking slowly--almost <br>invisibly--about, examining the terrain with the eye of an experienced <br>infantryman. Godenov was listening intently. MacIlargie had a quizzical <br>expression on his face and didn't seem to be paying any attention. He had <br>the kind of face that should have been framed by long, tangled hair, and a <br>mustache with ends that drooped to below his chin wouldn't have seemed out <br>of place--but Marine regulations required short hair and forbade mustaches <br>that long.<br> <br>"Are you listening to me, MacIlargie?" Chan snapped.<br> <br>"What's that smell?" MacIlargie asked.<br> <br>Taken aback by the unexpected question, Chan sniffed. He hadn't <br>noticed any aroma that might indicate danger. "What smell?" he asked. "I <br>don't smell anything."<br> <br>Godenov, a big young man, deceptively soft-looking, took a deep <br>breath. He didn't smell anything either.<br> <br>Schultz seemed to pay no attention to the exchange--he knew what <br>MacIlargie noticed and that it was irrelevant.<br> <br>"That's what I mean," MacIlargie said. "Something's missing." His face <br>lit up with a broad smile as he realized what it was. "Okay, now we see <br>how sharp you are. What's missing? If you can't tell that, you're not <br>going to be very good on patrols when we go on operations for real." He <br>grinned at the others.<br> <br>Godenov got it first. "The air doesn't smell like fish!"<br> <br>"Izzy, if I was in charge, I'd make you my second in command," <br>MacIlargie exclaimed. "You get out here in the toolies, you gotta be <br>sharp, and you're the only one who figured that out."<br> <br>Chan simply looked at MacIlargie's grinning face, hovering in the <br>middle of the clearing like the last glimpse of a Cheshire cat. <br>MacIlargie, like Godenov, was on his first assignment after Boot Camp. <br>Both had recently joined the platoon as replacements for men lost on the <br>FIST's last operation, peacekeeping on Elneal. Chan himself had been on <br>four combat operations, including one with the 34th FIST. Schultz was more <br>experienced than he was.<br> <br>MacIlargie staggered, then almost fell, and yelped. Schultz, in his <br>deceptively casual, almost invisible way, had come near and hit him with <br>an elbow--hard. Schultz's disembodied voice mumbled something that might <br>have been an apology but probably wasn't.<br> <br>MacIlargie recovered his balance and spun toward where he thought <br>Schultz was. For a second it seemed he'd attack Schultz if he could find <br>him. But only for a second. He remembered what Schultz looked like when he <br>was visible--Schultz moved languidly and seldom had much to say, but he <br>exuded a dangerous self-confidence that gave strong men pause.<br> <br>Chan spoke up: "We're going to that hill. MacIlargie, take point. <br>Godenov, bring up the rear. Now. Move it out."<br> <br>Schultz gave Chan a look that said, I should have the point. Chan said <br>again, "MacIlargie, move out." Then he added to Schultz, "This is <br>training. He needs the experience."<br> <br>Schultz nodded, satisfied that Chan understood that if it had been a <br>real operation, he was the one who would take the most dangerous and <br>important spot in the patrol column.<br><br>The tor was closer than it had looked. It was a broad, low platform of <br>limestone, forced upward in terraces by an up-welling of magma deep below <br>the surface. Scree dotted the ground at the foot of the tor's steep side.<br> <br>MacIlargie stopped at the foot of the hill and looked back at Chan, <br>uncertain what to do next.<br> <br>Schultz brushed past both of them and started climbing the eight-meter <br>cliff to the first terrace.<br> <br>Chan looked back and saw Godenov's face hovering as he stood watching.<br> <br>"Watch our rear, Godenov," Chan said. "That's the rear point's job: <br>watch the rear."<br> <br>Godenov started. "Oh." He turned around and dropped to one knee to <br>peer into the thin trees behind them.<br> <br>Even though he could barely make out where Godenov was, Chan saw that <br>he wasn't in position to effectively watch the rear. He shook his head and <br>wondered what they were teaching recruits in Boot Camp these days. Surely <br>he'd been better than that at field craft when he went on his first <br>assignment. He briefly considered taking the time to show the young man <br>how to pick a better position, but instead said to MacIlargie, "Follow the <br>man."<br> <br>Schultz's climbing noises indicated he was already over the top of the <br>first terrace. Chan flipped down his infras so he could watch his men. <br>When MacIlargie was halfway up the first terrace, Chan sent Godenov after <br>him. He then gave the trees near the base of the hill a quick once-over. <br>When his infras didn't show anything man-size in them, he followed.<br> <br>The higher terraces and slopes were older than those below. As the <br>Marines climbed, it became easier because the increased erosion made the <br>slopes gentler. Here and there crevasses and cave mouths dimpled the tor.<br> <br>Once, when they were close to each other, Schultz said to Chan, "I <br>know this place. If we have to, we can hide."<br> <br>It didn't take long to approach the top. "Off the hori-zon, people," <br>Chan said when he saw two man-size pillars of rock above. He was crouched <br>below the top, as he knew Schultz was.<br> <br>One of the rock pillars rippled, and MacIlargie's face appeared above <br>it. "What do you mean?" he asked. "We're wearing chameleons, nobody can <br>see us."<br> <br>"Chameleons pick up the nearest colors," Chan said, "not what's behind <br>you. You look like a man-made pile of stone up there."<br> <br>Rocks seemed to shift as MacIlargie shrugged. "A man-size pile of rock <br>doesn't have to be a man, it's just a pile of rocks."<br> <br>Chan flipped down his infras. "These tell me you're a man, not a pile <br>of rock," he said. "Off the top of the hill."<br> <br>MacIlargie snorted. "You've got to be less than a kilometer away for <br>infras to show enough detail."<br> <br>"Hoppers have infras that can pick out a man as far as the horizon. <br>Get down." Godenov had already dropped down to the military crest of the <br>hill.<br> <br>MacIlargie's face disappeared and his rock pile rippled as he turned <br>in a circle. "I don't see any hoppers out there," he said as his face <br>reappeared.<br> <br>"You don't know anything about evasive flying, do you?"<br> <br>MacIlargie yelped and his face dropped through the space that no <br>longer looked like a man-size pile of rocks.

Four families each lost three relatives; in other cases, children were left orphaned after both parents were murdered. For years there were claims that loyalists were helped and guided by members of the RUC and Ulster Defence Regiment. But, until now, there was no proof. Drawing on 15 years of research, and using forensic and ballistic information never before published, this book includes official documents showing that the highest in the land knew of the collusion and names those whose fingers were on the trigger and who detonated the bombs. It draws on previously unpublished reports written by the PSNI&#39;s own Historical Enquiries Team. It also includes heartbreaking interviews with the bereaved families whose lives were shattered by this cold and calculated campaign.</p><p>Anne Cadwallader is an experienced journalist, originally from London.

Yet in a remarkable sixty-year career that began in 1926, he designed more than 500 retail stores, hotels, apartment complexes, and stage sets that captured the popular spirit and changing face of Main Street America in the twentieth century.<br>Lapidus created fantasy environments in which America's middle class, flush with expanding postwar incomes and optimism, could fulfill its desire for glamor, relaxed luxury, and leisure. His signature forms - chevrons, "beanpoles," "woggles," or amoeba shapes, and curving walls and ceilings punctuated by "cheese holes," or cutouts - have become treasured icons of American postwar vernacular architecture.<br>Born in Russia in 1902, Lapidus was brought to New York by his parents a year later, and the family first settled on the Lower East Side. He completed his architecture degree at Columbia University and first earned a reputation by designing stage sets and retail stores in which he developed new theories in store design and essentially created the modern storefront as we now know it.<br>For his famed resort hotels of the 1950s Lapidus designed not only the vast structures but a melange of quasi-French provincial and Italian Renaissance decorative elements that critics would dub "Miami Beach French," including everything from the tableware to his famous "stairways to nowhere." He was one of the first architects to acknowledge the cinema as an overriding influence on American taste.</p><p>Morris Lapidus designed more than 500 retail stores, hotels, and apartments during his 60-year career as an architect. The work, chronicled in his new autobiography, &#34;Too Much Is Never Enough&#34;, is a testament to his roots in set and costume design for theater and to the glamour he brought to the most basic buildings and interiors. In an age when appropriation was not the rage, Lapidus pioneered this signature element of post-modernism, combining details of French Provincial and Italian Romanesque architecture with whimsical ornament and an unrestrained use of color. Lapidus&#39; writing, while a bit self-aggrandizing, is sweet and surprisingly engaging., making the book a delight all the way around.The architect Morris Lapidus was a post-modernist long before the term existed. Shunned by architectural critics for most of his shamelessly successful career, Mr. Lapidus . . . is just coming into his own, at the age of 94. -- <i>The New York Times Book Review, Eric Nash</i></p><h2>Wined and Died (A Home Crafting Mystery, 5)</h2><p><p>Something is brewing in Cadyville, and it's not only dandelion wine.

Lively vignettes of Conservative, Evangelical, Friends General Conference, and Friends United meetings illuminate basic Quaker theology and reflect the group's diversity while also highlighting the fundamental unity within the religion. Quaker culture encompasses a rich tradition of practice even as believers continue to debate whether Quakerism is necessarily Christian, where religious authority should reside, how one transmits faith to children, and how gender and sexuality shape religious belief and behavior. Praised for its rich insight and wide-ranging perspective, The Quakers in America is a penetrating account of an influential, vibrant, and often misunderstood religious sect.<br> Known best for their long-standing commitment to social activism, pacifism, fair treatment for Native Americans, and equality for women, the Quakers have influenced American thought and society far out of proportion to their relatively small numbers. Whether in the foreign policy arena (the American Friends Service Committee), in education (the Friends schools), or in the arts (prominent Quakers profiled in this book include James Turrell, Bonnie Raitt, and James Michener), Quakers have left a lasting imprint on American life. This multifaceted book is a concise history of the Religious Society of Friends; an introduction to its beliefs and practices; and a vivid picture of the culture and controversies of the Friends today. <br><br>The book opens with lively vignettes of Conservative, Evangelical, Friends General Conference, and Friends United meetings that illuminate basic Quaker concepts and theology and reflect the group's diversity in the wake of the sectarian splintering of the nineteenth century. Yet the book also examines commonalities among American Friends that demonstrate a fundamental unity within the religion: their commitments to worship, the ministry of all believers, decision making based on seeking spiritual consensus rather than voting, a simple lifestyle, and education. Thomas Hamm shows that Quaker culture encompasses a rich tradition of practice even as believers continue to debate a number of central questions: Is Quakerism necessarily Christian? Where should religious authority reside? Is the self sacred? How does one transmit faith to children? How do gender and sexuality shape religious belief and behavior? Hamm's analysis of these debates reveals a vital religion that prizes both unity and diversity.</p><p>Thomas D.

The conflict between these groups is now the source of bitter and widespread controversy and confrontation. It has become the issue in the last decade of the twentieth century.<br>Dictatorship of Virtue is a passionate, provocative, and rigorously documented examination of multiculturalism - its noble roots and the abuses and excesses perpetrated in its name.<br>To its advocates, multiculturalism is simply an intense effort to include in the mainstream of American life groups of people who have been excluded or marginalized in the past. These advocates argue that the essentially European identity that has dominated American life until now must make room for other identities; "inclusion" is key.<br>To its critics, multiculturalism means in practice the opposite of what it means in theory: they see it as a new, easily reproducible boilerplate of received ideas and unexamined assumptions that insists on adherence - with truth and fairness often falling victim to the demands of ethnic or racial self-esteem.<br>Richard Bernstein takes us to the front lines of this war for America's intellectual future: battles over school curricula, local legislation, college reading lists, censorship and freedom of expression, and "sexist" language. He explores the burgeoning industry of "diversity training," the inroads of questionable scholarship, and the fates of men and women victimized by political correctness.<br>While applauding the true meaning of multiculturalism - equality of opportunity and social justice - Bernstein fears that there is a pulling away from certain cultural norms, adherence to which traditionally has enabled Americans to board the great engine of upward social mobility. Multiculturalism, that universe of good intentions born of the civil rights movement and deriving from principles all good people hold dear, has too often become a dictatorship of virtue. What this means for our society and what we can do about it is brilliantly and lucidly presented in a book that will stand as an important contribution to the great debate of the nineties - and beyond.</p><p>y provocative book that will generate debate for years to come, Bernstein shows how multicultural orthodoxy has created a highly lucrative bureaucracy, even as it shortchanged the very people it is meant to benefit. &#34;Graceful and lucid. . . . reading the book is arguably a civic duty.&#34;--Boston Globe.<b>Richard Bernstein </b>has been a reporter, culture critic, and commentator for more than 30 years.

Toll has been a Wall Street analyst, a Federal Reserve financial analyst, and a political aide and speechwriter. A lifelong sailor, Toll&#39;s research into British and American naval history dates back to the early 1990&#39;s, when he was first introduced to the historical novels of Patrick O&#39;Brian. Six Frigates is his first bookThe birth of the U.S. Navy and its coming-of-age in battle against the French, the Barabary/Tripolitan pirates, and the British are recounted in this work. In the 1790s, a new navy was built around six new frigates that incorporated numerous technological innovations. These ships, along with their leaders and crews, cemented many of the traditions of our naval service. Stephen Lang effortlessly displays the qualities that make him a popular narrator. Foremost is his consistency. As we hear of how USS Constitution earned her nickname of "Old Ironsides" and the audacity of the raiders led by Lt. Stephen Decatur to burn USS Philadelphia in Tripoli, we are treated to Lang's smooth baritone, subtle expression, and seemingly effortless delivery.

Within this broad outline, authors Oswyn Murray, John Boardman, and Jasper Griffin, all distinguished Oxford University scholars, outline patterns of trade and colonization, look at the rise of philosophical schools and religions, and examine key works of literature. <i>Oxford History of the Classical World</i>, heavily illustrated with photographs and maps, is a fine reference, complete with compact chronologies.Thirty-two chapters (with select bibliographies) by different authors, plus an introduction and conclusion, survey antiquity from the time of Homer to the fall of the Roman Empire. Part 1 covers Greece, part 2, the Hellenistic age and the evolution of the Roman republic,and part 3, Imperial Rome. The range is wide, embracing history, myth, literary genres, major authors, philosophy, life, society, art, and architecture. All contributors are not equally successful in their attempt to condense, interpret, and inspire, but generally the results are of high quality, and the book is handsomely produced. Recommended for those desiring a one-volume introduction to the classical world.Robert J.

Color illustrations throughout.</p><p>I'm not going to pretend this book makes any sense. But it is funny as all heck. It's about ... well ... a dog and a rabbit-like creature who operate as "freelance police," going around town and stopping crime where they can. You may be familiar with the Sam &amp; Max CD-ROM game from Lucas Art. I mean, either way, how can you not buy a book that has the line, "Oboy! It's the colorized version of Citizen Kane... oh, my mistake--it's just the Flintstones."Sam, a trenchcoat-clad hound, and Max, described as a "small rabbity thing," the anthropomorphic heroes of the cult comic book collected in this volume, are a far cry from the benignly humorous critters of traditional funny animal comics. Their outlandish cases take them from ancient Egypt (where they confront pyramid-building aliens) and the moon (which they rid of giant cockroaches) to the local supermarket (where they encounter an ectoplasmic manifestation from the spirit world). But their nearly plotless adventures are basically just setups for letting the trigger-happy pair commit senseless but hilarious havoc that both parodies the violence pervading contemporary pop culture and updates and escalates the entertaining catharsis of classic animated cartoon mayhem. Purcell adds to the hilarity by working in hundreds of background gags that evoke the heyday of <i>Mad</i> comics. Sam and Max are probably less known in their comics incarnation than as stars of a popular video game. This collection gives their video audience opportunity to check out their original appearance in comics. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>A Man In Full</h2><p>A decade ago, <b>The Bonfire of the Vanities</b> defined an era&#x2014;and established Tom Wolfe as our prime fictional chronicler of America at its most outrageous and alive. Now the master is back with a pitch-perfect coast-to-coast portrait of our wild and wooly, no-holds-barred, multifarious country on the cusp of the millennium.<br><br>The setting is Atlanta, Georgia&#x2014;a racially mixed, late-century boomtown full of fresh wealth and wily politicians. The protagonist is Charles Croker, once a college football star, now a late-middle-aged Atlanta conglomerate king whose outsize ego has at last hit up against reality. Charlie has a 29,000 acre quail-shooting plantation, a young and demanding second wife, and a half-empty office complex with a staggering load of debt.<br><br>Meanwhile, Conrad Hensley, idealistic young father of two, is laid off from his job at the Croker Global Foods warehouse near Oakland and finds himself spiraling into the lower depths of the American legal system. And back in Atlanta, when star Georgia Tech running back Fareek "the Canon" Fanon, a homegrown product of the city's slums, is accused of date-raping the daughter of a pillar of the white establishment, upscale black lawyer Roger White II is asked to represent Fanon and help keep the city's delicate racial balance from blowing sky-high.<br><br>Networks of illegal Asian immigrants crisscrossing the continent, daily life behind bars, shady real estate syndicates&#x2014;Wolfe shows us contemporary America with all the verve, wit, and insight that have made him our most admired novelist. Charlie Croker's deliverance from his tribulations provides an unforgettable denouement to the most widely awaited, hilarious and telling novel America has seen in ages&#x2014;Tom Wolfe's most outstanding achievement to date.</p><p>Ever since he published his classic 1972 essay "Why They Aren't Writing the Great American Novel Anymore," Tom Wolfe has made his fictional preferences loud and clear. For New Journalism's poster boy, minimalism is a wash, not to mention a failure of nerve. The real mission of the American writer is to produce fat novels of social observation--the sort of thing Balzac would be dishing up if he had made it into the Viagra era. Wolfe's manifesto would have had a hubristic ring if he hadn't actually delivered the goods in 1987 with <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. Now, more than a decade later, he's back with a second novel. Has the Man in White lived up to his own mission?<p> On many counts, the answer would have to be yes. Like its predecessor, <i>A Man in Full</i> is a big-canvas work, in which a multitude of characters seems to be ascending or (rapidly) descending the greasy pole of social life: "In an era like this one," a character reminds us, "the twentieth century's <i>fin de siï¿½cle</i>, position was everything, and it was the hardest thing to get." Wolfe has changed terrain on us, to be sure. Instead of New York, the focus here is Atlanta, Georgia, where the struggle for turf and power is at least slightly patinated with Deep South gentility. The plot revolves around Charlie Croker, an egomaniacal good ol' boy with a crumbling real-estate empire on his hands. But Wolfe is no less attentive to a pair of supporting players: a downwardly mobile family man, Conrad Hensley, and Roger White II, an African American attorney at a white-shoe firm. What ultimately causes these subplots to converge--and threatens to ignite a racial firestorm in Atlanta--is the alleged rape of a society deb by Georgia Tech football star Fareek "The Cannon" Fanon.</p><p> Of course, a <i>detailed</i> plot summary would be about as long as your average minimalist novel. Suffice it to say that <i>A Man in Full</i> is packed with the sort of splendid set pieces we've come to expect from Wolfe. A quail hunt on Charlie's 29,000-acre plantation, a stuffed-shirt evening at the symphony, a politically loaded press conference--the author assembles these scenes with contagious delight. The book is also very, very funny. The law firms, like upper-crust powerhouse Fogg Nackers Rendering &amp; Lean, are straight out of Dickens, and Wolfe brings even his minor characters, like professional hick Opey McCorkle, to vivid life: </p><blockquote>In true Opey McCorkle fashion he had turned up for dinner wearing a plaid shirt, a plaid necktie, red felt suspenders, <i>and</i> a big old leather belt that went around his potbelly like something could hitch up a mule with, but for now he had cut off his usual torrent of orotund rhetoric mixed with Baker Countyisms.</blockquote> Readers in search of a kinder, gentler Wolfe may well be disappointed. Retaining the satirist's (necessary) superiority to his subject, he tends to lose his edge precisely when he's trying to move us. Still, when it comes to maximalist portraiture of the American scene--and to sheer, sentence-by-sentence amusement--1998 looks to be the year of the Wolfe, indeed. <i>--James Marcus</i>"A masterpiece."<br>--The Wall Street Journal<br><br>"Superior...utterly engrossing."<br>--USA Today<br><br>"The novel contains passages as powerful and as beautiful as anything written--not merely by contemporary American novelists but by any American novelist....The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written; at the same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Wolfe is a peerless observer, a fearless satirist, a genius in full."<br>--People</p><h2>Yves Klein: With the Void, Full Powers</h2><p>One of the last century's most influential artists, Yves Klein (1928&#x2013;1962) took the European art scene by storm in a prolific career that lasted only from 1954 to 1962, when he suffered a heart attack at the age of 34. Klein was an innovator who embraced painting, sculpture, performance, photography, music, theater, film, architecture and theoretical writing. Self-identified as &#x201c;the painter of space,&#x201d; Klein sought to achieve immaterial spirituality through pure color (primarily an ultramarine blue of his own invention&#x2015;International Klein Blue) and even went so far as to present white galleries emptied of all artworks for his renowned 1958 exhibition of &#x201c;the Void.&#x201d; His diverse oeuvre represents a pivotal transition from modern art's concern with the material object to contemporary notions of the conceptual nature of art. <i>Yves Klein: With the Void, Full Powers</i> is published to accompany the first major retrospective of the artist's work in the United States in nearly 30 years. It includes examples from all of Klein's major series, including his <i>Anthropometries, Cosmogonies,</i> fire paintings, planetary reliefs and blue monochromes, as well as selections of his lesser-known gold and pink monochromes, body and sponge reliefs, &#x201c;air architecture&#x201d; and immaterial works. Essays by curators Kerry Brougher and Philippe Vergne, Klein scholar Klaus Ottmann, art historian Kaira M. Cabaï¿½as and curatorial fellow Andria Hickey, as well as archival materials and translations of Klein's published and unpublished writings, offer insights into the artist's endeavors and process.<br>Born in Nice, France, in 1928, <b>Yves Klein</b> created what he considered his first artwork when he signed the sky above Nice in 1947, making his earliest attempt to capture the immaterial. The artist carved out new aesthetic and theoretical territory based on his study of the mystical sect Rosicrucianism, philosophical and poetic investigations of space and science, and the practice of Judo, which he described as &#x201c;the discovery of the human body in a spiritual space.&#x201d;</p><p>IN 1958, YVES KLEIN scandalized the Parisian public by presenting nothing but a whitewashed room with a lone, empty vitrine at Galerie Iris Clert. The exhibition, known as &#34;Le Vide&#34; (The Void), was marked by the momentousness of its opening. Among the guests was Albert Camus, who presented Klein with a piece of paper bearing the phrase &#34;Avec le vide les pleins pouvoirs&#34; (With the void, full powers). The room, Klein asserted, contained an &#34;invisible pictorial state,&#34; one that is &#34;direct&#34; and requires no &#34;intermediaries.&#34; Yet these claims of pure presence had to be reinforced: Klein limited the number of visitors allowed in the room at one time by stationing a pair of security guards at the gallery&#39;s entrance...</p><h2>High School Talksheets: 50 Ready-to-Use Discussions on the Life of Christ</h2><p><p>Your high school students probably think they know a lot about Jesus.

His most recent book is <i>The Sixth Man</i>.</b></p> <p> </p><p>I'm no stranger to Gregg Hurwitz's work. I tore through Trust No One like a meth addict on a binge. The guy does his best work, I think, when he takes a murky past and slams it in the face of his protagonist decades later. You're Next is right in this wheelhouse. The Prologue is pure adrenaline, heart-wrenching and starts the novel off on a terrific trajectory. A little boy wakes up and over the course of a few pages he is abandoned by his father. The reader takes an emotional arrow right in the heart. Right away we want to know more about the kid and what became of him. Lots of questions unanswered. But you know with Hurwitz that while the questions eventually will be answered, they won't be in ways the reader can easily predict.</p> <p>The boy has grown into a man, but he can't escape his past. Mike is a good guy trying to make a living for his family. An environmentally conscious builder, he works hard and tries to stand by his word. Before he can draw a breath he's hit by a tsunami. Events tumble out, each one more inexplicable and seemingly disconnected than its predecessor. What Hurwitz also does extremely well is put one in the moment. Big scenes are tough to write, but the smaller ones are tougher still. It's like the tendons and ligaments connecting the large muscle masses together. You mess those up, nothing else works right. He's also a fine wordsmith. "A gloved fist the size of a dumbbell flew at her, shattering her eye socket and knocking her back into the front door, rocketing it inward so hard the handle stuck in the drywall. A moment of tranquility. Even the crickets were awed into silence...His plain, handsome face was oddly smooth, almost generic, as if his features were pressed through latex." Good, good stuff.</p> <p>What Mike now faces are demons from his past. Desperate, organized, efficiently ruthless men are coming for him. But now it's not just Mike. He has a family, wife Annabel and their daughter Kat, a precocious eight-year-old. He has an ally from old days, before he was Mike, husband, businessman, father. The survival instinct takes over and the battle is engaged. I read lots of thrillers and mysteries, and have gotten pretty good at separating the wheat from the chaff, figuring out the foreshadowing, what seemingly insignificant clues, what seemingly throw-off lines and what nuggets of seemingly useless information are actually critical to understanding the plot. But Hurwitz is a skilled hand and at the end of the day I say just let this baby ride till the last page. Then you can close the book, stammer something about that SOB getting you again, and you can wait with breathless anticipation for the man to reload his Glock and fire away on his next thriller.</p> <br><p><b>"SMART AND RELENTLESS...never, never lets up..." </b><br><b><i>&#x2015;Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></b></p><p>Mike Wingate had a rough childhood&#x2015;-he was abandoned at a playground at four years old and raised in foster care.

And in the distance, all but lost in these great sweeps of rock and sky, a group of teenagers, fresh out of suburban America, are struggling desperately to build new lives-beyond crack and crystal mete, beyond sadness, beyond a pain that has brought many to the brink of self-destruction.<br><br>In <i>Shouting at the Sky, </i>award-winning writer Gary Ferguson is once again bound for the back-country, this time to spend a season in one of the country's most remarkable programs for troubled teens. Here you'll share in the daily triumphs and heartaches of an unforgettable group of kids. Witness their shock at the wilderness, outrageous with its bluster and open spaces, its lack of bathrooms and cooked meals, its absence of television, malls and old friends. Huddle with them on moonlit nights around a juniper fire. Sit for an afternoon on a canyon rim in the middle of nowhere and listen to their stories and poems: tales of anorexia and amphetamines, of depression and workaholic parents, of the grating fear that will not let them be.<br><br><i>Shouting at the Sky </i>is a story resplendent with glimpses into power of the human spirit and the healing that is possible when the beauty and challenges of the wild are linked to it. But along these trails can also be found issues of striking gravity: insights into how young lives can go terribly wrong and, in the end, how many of our fondest hopes for tomorrow and teetering on the brink, waiting for us to find the will, the courage to build more genuine connections to our children. <br><br>"I can't imagine being broken down without a wild place to fall apart in," Ferguson writes. So this is also a very personal account of his participation as an observer, leader, and storyteller in the rites of passage these teenagers undergo in the Utah desert. It is a story of individuals, counselors and participants alike, grown-ups and youths, sharing the struggle to find themselves.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Gary Ferguson </b>has written more than a dozen books on nature and science. His 1997 book, <i>The Sylvan Path: A Journey Through America's Forests </i>(released in trade paperback as <i>Through the Woods</i>), was a winner of the prestigious Lowell Thomas Awards, <i>Spirits of the Wild: The World's Great Nature Myths </i>was selected by the New York City Public Library as one of the best books of 1996.

He and his wife, Jane, live in Red Lodge, Montana. For more information, visit Gary at his web site: www.wildwords.net.<br><br>This tale of teenagers struggling to remake their lives in the wilds of southern Utah manages to be both deeply lyrical and seriously sappy. Nature writer Ferguson (The Sylvan Path: A Journey Through Americas Forests, 1997) spent several months as a kind of counselor-cum-observer with the Aspen Achievement Academy, a wilderness therapy program whose philosophy blends pioneer self-reliance with a generous helping of New Age blather. The students, plagued by everything from drugs to depression to attention-deficit and eating disorders, are grizzled veterans of countless failed therapeutic schemes. Now they are dumped in a particularly stark stretch of Mormon country, stripped, searched, and outfitted for a two-month, no-frills desert and mountain sojourn. Dividing his time between one group of girls and another of boys, Ferguson charts the participants' emotional and physical evolution, from their early days as ``mice,'' timid beginners who have to count aloud each time they use the bathroom so their counselors can keep track of them, into seasoned adventurers who can fend for themselves and, hopefully, bring some of what they've learned in the wild back home with them. Along the way, Ferguson hangs out with the hipper-than-thou staff and recounts stories of suicide watches, escape attempts , and countless therapy sessions. When he depicts the rigors and the beauty of the landscape, Ferguson's prose approaches poetry, and his stories about kids who can't concentrate long enough to finish a sentence mastering the painstaking art of starting a fire from a bow drill speak volumes about what these programs do best. But the author's thumbnail character sketches read more like allegories of American ailments than the real stories of troubled young people, and his ecstatic embrace of all things mystical and Native American sometimes verges on parody. At its best, this book testifies to nature's ability to heal and inspire. At its worst, it's like being stuck on a long camping trip with Shirley MacLaine. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It describes and illustrates the results of more than fifteen years of elegant experimental studies conducted by the author. In his investigations, Thomas Seeley has sought the answer to the question of how a colony of bees is organized to gather its resources. The results of his research--including studies of the shaking signal, tremble dance, and waggle dance, and other, more subtle means by which information is exchanged among bees--offer the clearest, most detailed picture available of how a highly integrated animal society works. By showing how several thousand bees function together as an integrated whole to collect the nectar, pollen, and water that sustain the life of the hive, Seeley sheds light on one of the central puzzles of biology: how units at one level of organization can work together to form a higher-level entity.</p><p>In explaining why a hive is organized the way it is, Seeley draws on the literature of molecular biology, cell biology, animal and human sociology, economics, and operations research. He compares the honey bee colony to other functionally organized groups: multicellular organisms, colonies of marine invertebrates, and human societies. All highly cooperative groups share basic problems: of allocating their members among tasks so that more urgent needs are met before less urgent ones, and of coordinating individual actions into a coherent whole. By comparing such systems in different species, Seeley argues, we can deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that make close cooperation a reality.</p></p><p>Thomas D.

Her dreams seem coming true, yet she wonders whether she is missing the love of a lifetime in her friendship with Katchoo. After much debate, and the added complication of pregnancy, Francine decides to call off the wedding, return to Houston, and see what happens.

It is a humanity whose lies and silences emerge as endearing and oddly bracing individual truths." <br>--Richard Eder, <i>New York Times Book Review<br></i><b><br></b><br>"The interweaving of human and philosophical intrigue is very much as I remember it in <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, as is the slow, dense beginning and the relentless gathering of pace . . . But, in my view, his book is by far the better of the two. I would go so far as to say that Pamuk achieves the very thing his book implies is impossible . . . More than any other book I can think of, it captures not just Istanbul's past and present contradictions, but also its terrible, timeless beauty. It's almost perfect, in other words. All it needs is the Nobel Prize." <br>--Maureen Freely, <i>New Statesman</i>, UK<br><i><br></i>"A perfect example of Pamuk's method as a novelist, which is to combine literary trickery with page-turning readability . . . As a meditation on art, in particular, <i>My Name is Red</i> is exquisitely subtle, demanding and repaying the closest attention . . We in the West can only feel grateful that such a novelist as Pamuk exists, to act as a bridge between our culture and that of a heritage quite as rich as our own."<br>--Tom Holland, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, UK<br><br>"Readers . . . will find themselves lured into a richly described and remarkable world . . . Reading the novel is like being in a magically exotic dream . . .Splendidly enjoyable and rewarding . . . A book in which you can thoroughly immerse yourself."<br>--Allan Massie, <i>The Scotsman</i>, UK<br><br>"A wonderful novel, dreamy, passionate and august, exotic in the most original and exciting way. Orhan Pamuk is indisputably a major novelist."<br> --Philip Hensher, <i>The Spectator</i>, UK<br><br>"[In this] magnificent new novel... Pamuk takes the reader into the strange and beautiful world of Islamic art,in which Western notions no longer make sense .... In this world of forgeries, where some might be in danger of losing their faith in literature, Pamuk is the real thing, and this book might well be one of the few recent works of fiction that will be remembered at the end of this century."<br>--Avkar Altinel, <i>The Observer</i>, UK<br><br>From one of the most important and acclaimed writers at work today, a thrilling new novel--part murder mystery, part love story--set amid the perils of religious repression in sixteenth-century Istanbul. <br>When the Sultan commissions a great book to celebrate his royal self and his extensive dominion, he directs Enishte Effendi to assemble a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed, and no one in the elite circle can know the full scope or nature of the project. <br>Panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears, and the Sultan demands answers within three days. The only clue to the mystery--or crime?--lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Has an avenging angel discovered the blasphemous work? Or is a jealous contender for the hand of Enishte's ravishing daughter, the incomparable Shekure, somehow to blame? <br>Orhan Pamuk's "My Name Is Red is at once a fantasy and a philosophical puzzle, a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex, and power.</p><h2>Man And The Natural World</h2><p>An account of the changing attitudes in people towards nature and the environment between 1500-1800, and comparing and contrasting this with our present attitude towards it.</p><p>Preserving the environment, saving the rain forests, and preventing the extinction of species may seem like fairly recent concerns, but in Man and the Natural World, Sir Keith Thomas explores how these ideas took root long ago. In this entertaining and illuminating history, Thomas aims not just to explain present interest in preserving the environment and protecting the rights of animals, but to reconstruct an earlier mental world as well. Throughout the ages humankind has attempted to rationalize its place in nature. At no time was the idea of exploiting the earth for our own advantage so sharply challenged as in England between the sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries. For it was during these years that there occurred a whole cluster of changes in the way in which men and women, at all social levels, perceived the natural world around them. Thomas seeks to expose the assumptions which underlay the views and feelings of the inhabitants of early modern England toward the animals, birds, vegetation, and physical landscape among which they spent their lives. The issues raised here are even more alive today than they were just ten years ago. This fascinating work deftly shows that it is impossible to disentangle what the people of the past thought about plants and animals from what they thought about themselves.Keith Thomas is a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was formerly President of Corpus Christi College and, before that, Professor of Modern History and Fellow of St John&#39;s College.

The shooting took place directly across the street from the White House, the home of Sickles&#x2019;s friend and protector, President James Buchanan. Sickles turned himself in; political friends in New York&#x2019;s Tammany Hall machinery, including the dynamic criminal lawyer James Brady, quickly gathered around. While his beautiful young wife was banned from public life and shunned by society, Dan Sickles was acquitted.<br><br><i>American Scoundrel</i> is the extraordinary story of this powerful mid-nineteenth century politician and inveterate womanizer, whose irresistible charms and rock-solid connections not only allowed him to get away with murder &#x2014; literally &#x2014; but also paved the way to a stunning career.<br><br>Once free to resume his life, Dan Sickles raised a regiment for the Union political elite and went on to become a general in the army, rising to the rank of brigadier general and commanding a flank at the Battle of Gettysburg in a maneuver so controversial it is still argued over by scholars today. After losing a leg in that battle, Sickles fought on and after the war became military governor of South Carolina, and later was named minister to Spain, where he continued astonishingly to conduct his amorous assignations.<br><br>With great brio and insight &#x2014; and a delight in bad behavior &#x2014; Thomas Keneally has brought to light a tale of American history that resonates with uncomfortable truths about our politics, ethics, and morality.</p><p>Politician, man about town, war hero, and murderer: Dan Sickles led many lives, some of them improbable, turning disaster to advantage. Thomas Keneally, whose novels have been populated by heroes and outlaws alike, vividly captures Sickles's life and times. A Tammany politician, for good and ill, Sickles earned national notoriety for gunning down his friend Philip Barton Key, the son of Francis Scott Key, in what his peers in Congress took to be an excusable crime of passion. Sickles made a glorious comeback with the Civil War, when the regiment he raised distinguished itself time and again under fire at places such as Chancellorsville and Gettysburg--where, defying orders in a bold maneuver, Sickles helped secure the Union victory. "His tendency toward berserk and full- blooded risk was partly characteristic of the city he had grown up in, the age he lived in, and his own soul," writes Keneally. Admired by no less than Mark Twain, Sickles figures only as a footnote in many histories. Ably recounting his triumphs and defeats, Thomas Keneally brings him front and center in a tale that will delight Civil War buffs. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>&#x201c;Spellbinding. . . . Riveting. . . .

You can tell Crowther has extensively studied Church history and thought deeply about the subject of each chapter. His research upholds what is taught by the Church but it goes into deeper detail with examples of member experiences. This book has enabled me to think more deeply about spiritual things and has added to my knowledge of things I know to be true. I enjoyed the numerous stories of dreams and visions of early members of the Church. Actually, many of the stories told are from members living in the early part of the 20th century also. Some stories are from the leaders of the Church but many are from the "average" members with strong testimonies. I was very touched by many of the stories. For people not of the Latter-Day Saint faith, it may be overwhelming with all the references to our core beliefs and extra details. It's best to already believe in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ before reading this book. The book is actually written to further the testimony and knowledge of a Latter-Day Saint member. --Amazon<br><br>So much interesting information...it's a good idea to study the scriptures (specifically the Book of Mormon) before your sessions of studying this...otherwise it's too easy to get overwhelmed and confused. Having the spirit to guide is a MUST. There were times when it felt like my head was going to explode trying to comprehend some of the subject matter, but after a few weeks of pondering and praying about it, it started to make sense and has had a profound positive impact on my perspective of life and the world around me. This wouldn't happen by just reading the book...the guidance of the Holy Spirit is crucial. --Amazon</p><h2>Hank Greenberg: The Hero of Heroes</h2><p><b>Baseball in the 1930s was more than a national pastime; it was a cultural touchstone that galvanized communities and gave a struggling country its heroes despite the woes of the Depression. Hank Greenberg, one of the most exciting sluggers in baseball history, gave the people of Detroit a reason to be proud.</b><p></p><p>But America was facing more than economic hardship. With the Nazis gaining power across Europe, political and social tensions were approaching a boiling point. As one of the few Jewish athletes competing nationally, Hank Greenberg became not only an iconic ball player, but also an important and sometimes controversial symbol of Jewish identity and the American immigrant experience.</p><p></p><p>When Hank joined the Detroit Tigers in 1933, they were headed for a dismal fifth-place season finish. The following year, with Hank leading the charge, they were fighting off the Yankees for the pennant. As his star ascended, he found himself cheered wherever he went. But there were other noises also. On and off the field, he met with taunts and anti-Semitic threats. Yet the hardship only drove him on to greater heights, sharing the spotlight with the most legendary sluggers of the day, including Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, and Lou Gehrig.</p><p></p><p><i>Hank Greenberg</i> offers an intimate account of the man&#x2019;s life on and off the field. It is a portrait of integrity, triumph over adversity, and one of the greatest baseball players to ever grace the field.</p></p><p><b>John Rosengren</b> is an award-winning author whose other books include <i>Hammerin' Hank,</i> <i>George Almighty and the Say Hey&nbsp;Kid: The Year That Changed Baseball Forever</i> and <i>Blades of Glory: The True Story of a Young Team Bred to Win</i>.

When he joined the Detroit Tigers in 1933, the team was just another also-ran, chasing the powerful New York Yankees. But in 1934, led by Greenberg&#x2019;s slugging, the Tigers won the pennant, though they lost the World Series. In 1935 the Tigers won the World Series. As Rosengren recounts this remarkable life story, we come to see how Greenberg bore more than the burden of athletic performance. He was a symbol of the Jewish community. Some in the community felt he should honor the Sabbath by not playing; others felt he should at least honor the High Holidays. Non-Jews vehemently argued that Greenberg should eschew all in favor of playing every time there was a game. Additionally, Greenberg was the target of virulent anti-Semitism. The discrimination wasn&#x2019;t the same or as pervasive as the insults Jackie Robinson would endure 15 years later, but it was every bit as much a fabric of American life. Greenberg only had nine complete seasons as a Major Leaguer, but his place in the Hall of Fame is indisputable. He lost one season to injury and nearly four more to military service during WWII. (He served 45 months, the longest of any Major League player.) Rosengren&#x2019;s text covers Greenberg&#x2019;s youth, his playing and military careers as well as his years as a Major League executive. This is a serious, carefully researched biography of an important historical figure who was also a famous athlete. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Muscle Man&#39;s Guide to Life (Regular Show)</h2><p>This 112-page paper-over-board guide to life according to Muscle Man, from the popular Cartoon Network program <i>Regular Show</i>, provides tips for everything from diet and fitness to winning ladies over!</p><p>Tracey West has written several titles for Grosset &amp; Dunlap and PSS!</p><h2>How to Love A Woman: On Intimacy and the Erotic Life of Women</h2><p><p>For all men and women who thirst to love and be loved by a woman, these words and stories of guidance from Clarissa Pinkola Estï¿½s are <i>aqua vitae,</i> the water of life for the soul.</p><p>Dr. Estï¿½s teaches that in love relationships, each partner challenges, nourishes, and transforms the other.

She shows us how we can use the cards to trigger awareness in ourselves of troubling aspects of our lives and histories, and then go beyond discovery to use the cards as tools for healing. This is part of the work that needs to be done with tarot in this new century." <br>&#x2015;Rachel Pollack, author of <em>78 Degrees of Wisdom </em>and the forthcoming <em>Shining Tribe Tarot <br> <br></em>Deep within our psyches, the unconscious holds our forbidden feelings, secret wishes, and creative urges. Over time, these "dark forces" take on a life of their own and form the shadow&#x2015;a powerful force of unresolved inner conflicts and unexpressed emotions that defies our efforts to control it. The shadow takes its shape from a menagerie of archetypes, each recognizable throughout time and around the world&#x2015;troubling characters who thrive within our persona. The shadow is sabateur, martyr, victim, addict, sadist, masochist, or tyrant; all the dark figures that prey on the lighter qualities of the human personality. <br> <br>The shadow also represents those latent talents and positive traits that were banished from us at some time along our life path: artistic, musical, athletic, or creative talents. An undeveloped ability, a dream that has gone unexpressed, a fantasy of what might have been&#x2015;these too make up the personal shadow, the lost parts of ourselves. <br> <br><em>Tarot Shadow Work</em> shows you how to free yourself from the shackles of the shadow's power. Through tarot work, journaling, meditation, creative visualization, and dream work, you will bring the shadow into the light. This book is ideal for those who are in recovery from a serious addiction or illness, as well as any person seeking a deeper understanding of his or her true self. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>By exploring the dark and uncharted territory of the unconscious mind, you will work towards understanding and integrating the shadow. No prior knowledge of the tarot is required. You will learn to use the cards as a tool to help you break free from negative patterns and self-destructive behavior. <br> <br>Once we realize that we are made of both light and darkness, life will start to make sense. When we accept our dual natures, we stop sabotaging our own efforts and learn to be compassionate with others and with ourselves.</p></p><p><b>Winter 2019 / 2020: </b><b></b><i>Tarot Shadow Work</i> is currently out of print<i>. </i>In the for-what-it-is-worth department, I am appalled at the prices of this book set by the used booksellers. Who wants to pay $58 (or much more) for a used tarot book?

As always, thank you for your interest in&nbsp;my books through the years.<i></i><i><b>Please Note: </b></i>I no longer have a tarot or book-related website.

I like to think of the shadow book as mystical therapy or a grief workbook. Because I borrow heavily from 12-Step programs, it is also a book of recovery. As with all my work, practical advice, psychology and mysticism peacefully coexist. <br>The phrase 'new age' is an umbrella term used to denote a whole range of interests including health and well-being, many forms of therapy and self-help, esoteric practices such as astrology and tarot, nontraditional religions and spirituality, concern for the environment, respect for nature and feminine wisdom. To some, it is synonymous with fluffy, feel-good nonsense. To others, it offers another way to look at the world. I am disheartened when reviewers feel the need to bash beliefs that differ from their own. <br>Llewellyn is a niche publisher of new age books. <i>Tarot Shadow Work</i> was published by Llewellyn, therefore it is a new age book produced by a new age press. Please do not buy my Llewellyn books if you are searching for mainstream treatment of the subject matter. I am always disappointed when reviewers find no value in my work. I can only hope that Mr. Frost returned the shadow book for a full refund. <br><br>Thank you for your continued interest!THE SHADOW KNOWS There is a shadow lurking in every person's inner life, a psychic darkness sheltering our inner conflicts and unexpressed emotions. It takes shape in a menagerie of archetypes, each recognizable throughout time and around the world- troubling characters who thrive within our persona. The shadow is the saboteur, martyr, victim, addict, sadist, masochist, or tyrant, all the dark figures that prey on the lighter qualities of the human personality. The shadow also represents those latent talents and positive traits that were banished from us at some time along our life path: artistic, musical, athletic or creative talents. Any undeveloped ability, a dream that has gone unexpressed, a fantasy of what might have been-these, too, make up the personal shadow, the lost parts of ourselves and are referred to as the Bright Shadow. To channel the negative characters in our personality, we must first bring them into our waking consciousness. <i>Tarot Shadow Work</i> will help you come to terms with life's dualities, show you how to embrace the darkness and teach you how to balance the light with the shadow in your own life. The entire world of the human psyche can be mapped out using the twenty-two cards of the tarot's major arcana, with each card tapping into a different quality of our psychology. Accepting that we are made of both light and darkness, life will start to make sense. When we accept our dual natures, we stop sabotaging our own efforts and learn to be compassionate with others and with ourselves.</p><h2>Traders to the Navajos the Story of the Wetherills</h2><p>Native American History.</p><p></p><h2>People of the Thunder: Book Two of the Moundville Duology (North America&#39;s Forgotten Past)</h2><p>By 1300 AD, the Sky Hand people had crushed and enslaved the Albaamaha people and built their high-walled capital, Split Sky City, to dominate towns up and down the Black Warrior River. But a violent wind is brewing that may topple the city's mighty walls. Great armies are on the march, and a cunning new leader, Smoke Shield, has risen. He will lead the Sky Hand people either to stunning triumph or to bloody doom. &nbsp;Old White, Trader, and the mystical Two Petals are journeying across the Choctaw lands straight into the chaos. Old White, the Seeker, must play a delicate game of espionage. For Trader the slightest indiscretion--let alone the temptation of forbidden love--could lead to disaster. Two Petals, the Contrary, faces the toughest choice of all : She must betray herself and her friends to Smoke Shield or live forever in the backward grip of madness. And Spirit Power has laid a far deadlier trap for them in the rainbow colors just beneath the rolling surface of the Black Warrior River. &nbsp;A novel of desperate political intrigue and spiritual power, <i>People of the Thunder</i> once again demonstrates the Gears' mastery of American prehistory. Explore the ancestral heritage of the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Yuchi peoples as the majesty and genius of the vanished Mississippian mound builders' civilization comes to life.</p><p>Kathleen O'Neal Gear is a former state historian and archaeologist for Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska for the U.S. Department of the Interior. She has twice received the federal government's Special Achievement Award for ""outstanding management"" of our nation's cultural heritage. &nbsp;W.

The Gears live in Thermopolis, WY.<p>One <br>The Contrary&#x2014;the woman once known as Two Petals&#x2014; walked through the quiet night. Her moccasin-clad feet scuffed the plaza&#x2019;s trampled surface, the sound of leather on clay like the whisper of distant ghosts. Her straight body moved purposefully, rounded hips swaying. Black flowing hair swung even with her buttocks, and she clutched a beaverhide blanket closely about her shoulders. With each exhalation, she watched her breath fog and rise toward the black, star-encrusted sky. Overhead, the constellations seemed to shimmer and wink against the winter night. <br>Around her, the great Yuchi capital known as Rainbow City slumbered. Even now the size of the city, with its tall, building- topped mounds, thousands of homes, temples, society houses, and granaries, amazed her. The city&#x2019;s sleeping soul surrounded her like the low hum of insect wings. She could feel the immensity of it: all those thousands of souls breathing, mired in Dreams, their passions muted by sleep. <br>This was the western capital of the Yuchi&#x2014;called the Tsoyaha in their own language. The city had been built on a high bluff overlooking the Tenasee River. The location had been chosen not only because it was well above the worst of the great river&#x2019;s periodic fl oods, but it was strategically placed just below the river&#x2019;s bend. Sheer heights on the east and north provided a natural defense, while the western and southern approaches were protected by a tall palisade bolstered by archers&#x2019; platforms every twenty paces. Rainbow City controlled passage up and down the Tenasee&#x2014;the trade route carrying goods between the southeastern and northern river systems. <br>Though Two Petals had walked in the ghostly ruins of Cahokia and climbed its great mound, Rainbow City left her feeling humbled. Cahokia was a place of dried bones; Rainbow City flexed warm nerve and healthy muscle. It lived, thrived, and bristled with energy. <br>High temples, palaces, and society houses perched atop square earthen mounds capped by colored clays sacred to the Yuchi. The buildings reminded Two Petals of brooding guardians overlooking the empty plaza. The image was strengthened by steeply pitched thatch roofs that jutted arrogantly toward the heavens. Beyond them lay a packed maze of circular houses, their thickly plastered walls and roofs a uniquely Yuchi architectural form. The dark dwellings hunched in the night, as though weighted by the countless sleeping souls they sheltered. <br>The Contrary needed but close her eyes in order to sense the occupants. She experienced their Dreams the way an anchored rock knew the river&#x2019;s current. The weight of their loves, hatreds, lusts, hungers, triumphs, and fears flowed around her. Were she to surrender her control, all of those demanding souls would fi lter past her skin, slip through her ears, nostrils, and mouth. Like permeable soil her body and souls would absorb them. Then, in the manner of a saturated earthen dam, she would slowly give way, carried off in bits, pieces, and streamers by the fl ood. <br>But I am not earth. No, I am a great stone. I stand resolute, lapped only by the waves of their Dreams. Feel them, washing up against me, seeking a grasp, only to drain away before the next. Two Petals clasped <br>her arms around her chest, hugging herself for reassurance. <br>She had come from a small Oneota village in the north, rescued from a charge of witchcraft by Old White. He was the legendary Seeker: the man who had traveled to the four corners of the world. Old White had chosen her to accompany him on this quest to the south. She&#x2019;d heard of the great cities&#x2014;places like Red Wing Town&#x2014;and even seen the abandoned sprawl that had been Cahokia. Nothing had prepared her for this concentration of humanity. On the night of her arrival, the mass of Rainbow City&#x2019;s humanity had overwhelmed her. The impact had left her comatose, deafened, and paralyzed. Now, by dint of will alone, she barely kept panic at bay. <br>You must learn to deal with what you have become, Two Petals told herself. Trouble is coming. <br>She sighed, sensing the perpetual isolation of a person touched by Power. Forget the Dreams of others; her own were frightening enough. Not so many moons past, while in Cahokia, she had been carried away on Sister Datura&#x2019;s arms&#x2014;borne off to the Spirit World. The visions she had had of the future remained just behind her eyes, as clear as when she&#x2019;d first seen them. Were she to beckon, they would come fl owing forward. She would again see the terrible black-souled chief, his hand trembling as it reached out to caress her naked skin. Or know the guilt-stricken eyes of a woman whose bloody hands dripped red spatters onto hard ground while she trembled beneath the twists of fate. In other scenes an angry war chief led a thousand warriors through a deadly and silent forest. And fi nally, swirling water washed over a great scaled hide that shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow. <br>She fixed on that final image, staring into the serpent&#x2019;s great crystalline eye, as though looking through time and worlds into another reality. As she did, a faint Song began to fill her souls with a tremolo that echoed from her very bones. The melody rose and fell, lifting her spirits like a leaf on the breeze. Two Petals could feel herself rising, spinning, carried aloft on the vibrant notes. She began to Dance across the hard-packed plaza, arms undulating to the beat, souls swaying in time to her skipping feet. The Song played within her. <br>Soon, she promised, her body spinning in time to the melody. <br>As quickly as it had come, the Song faded, leaving her to stand alone and motionless in Rainbow City&#x2019;s great plaza&#x2014;but one more of the many shadows that mingled in the night. In that instant she felt utterly destitute. <br>You are never truly alone, a familiar voice remarked. Over the years, she had grown used to the voices that spoke in her head. Sometimes they told convincingly of things she knew were untrue. Other times, they offered a startling insight into the confused reality around her. <br>This voice, though, she knew. Two Petals turned, seeing the eerie outline of Deer Man. He stood off to the side, watching her through large liquid- brown eyes. In the beginning, it had bothered her that only she could see him. That Deer Man could be so apparent to her, but not to Trader or Old White, had perplexed her. In the end, she simply accepted Deer Man&#x2019;s presence as a manifestation of her Contrary Power. Half-man, half-deer, he had a human face; deer antlers and ears sprouted from his head, and the sleek hair that covered his body could have graced a buck&#x2019;s winter hide. <br>Frowning, she studied him, wondering how he managed to balance on those slender deer legs that ended in delicately hoofed feet, or why he never left tracks in the soft dust or silty mud. Why the oddity of it continued to puzzle her was elusive. He was after all a Spirit Being. She often had seen him standing on water, waves washing through his feet, and other times with his nether regions passing through some object like a pestle and mortar, cane wall, or fallen log. As with so many of the voices that spoke to her, or the Spirits, ghosts, and other oddities she saw, she had wondered if Deer Man were real. <br>Real? Deer Man asked, hearing her thoughts. Are any of them real? Old White? Trader? The Kala Hi&#x2019;ki? He paused. Are you real, Contrary? <br>She tightened her arms around her, feeling the warm beaverhide cape, aware of the soft swell of her breasts, of the skin, muscle, and ribs beneath. The rise and fall of her chest with each breath she took reassured her. <br>I am. At least for this moment. She frowned. Can&#x2019;t say for sure about tomorrow... or yesterday. Sometimes the world slips and shifts around me. It just up and moves, and I lose track of what&#x2019;s what. Who&#x2019;s whom. Things become muddled and rushed. Then, when it all stops, I&#x2019;m not sure where I am, or how I got there. <br>Come. Let me show you something. Deer Man turned, walking off toward the south. <br>Two Petals followed, head cocked as she watched his hoofed feet. Though Deer Man took long steps, his hooves never seemed to make actual contact with the earth; and though he moved at her speed, his feet seemed to be making faster progress than he was. <br>How do you do that? <br>The same way every other creature does, he answered. It is no different than the way you move backward in time. <br>Two Petals didn&#x2019;t answer. So many things were riddles. That the world ran backward around her was just one more. <br>Still bothers you, doesn&#x2019;t it? <br>What? <br>That you&#x2019;re Contrary. That you can never be normal like Trader, Old White, or anyone else. <br>She nodded. A part of me, way deep down inside, still wants to be like normal people. But it is growing smaller and smaller. Soon, as we get closer to the end, it will shrink away completely. All that will be left is the Contrary. Two Petals will have been like a raindrop in the sunlight. <br>The Kala Hi&#x2019;ki has helped. I can see it in you: a strength that you didn&#x2019;t know you possessed. <br>She remembered the night when she, Trader, and Old White had first landed at Rainbow City. She had been frightened, overwhelmed by the images of a future that soon would be her past. The flood of souls around her had washed over and through her, drowning and suffocating. She wasn&#x2019;t sure exactly what had happened, but Trader had told her later that she&#x2019;d cried out and fallen over. He said that she&#x2019;d turned as stiff as wood, her muscles and joints locked and immovable. He&#x2019;d carried her to the Kala Hi&#x2019;ki&#x2019;s temple like some sort of oddly shaped log. All she remembered was a thick blackness until she&#x2019;d awakened in the Kala Hi&#x2019;ki&#x2019;s room. The terror of it was still too close. <br>Power had brought her here. Well, Power and the Kala Hi&#x2019;ki&#x2019;s not-too-friendly and well- armed warriors. During her long trip southward from her native Oneota lands, she&#x2019;d caught glimpses of the Kala Hi&#x2019;ki. Even as far away as Cahokia, she had seen him in her visions: a terrible man covered with burn s...</p></p><h2>Death or Victory</h2><p>An epic history of the battle of Quebec, the death of General James Wolfe and the beginnings of Britain&#39;s empire in North America. Military history at its best.Perched on top of a tall promontory, surrounded on three sides by the treacherous St Lawrence River, Quebec - in 1759 France&#39;s capital city in Canada - forms an almost impregnable natural fortress. That year, with the Seven Years&#39; War raging around the globe, a force of 49 ships and nearly 9,000 men commanded by the irascible General James Wolfe, navigated the river, scaled the cliffs and laid siege to the town in an audacious attempt to expel the French from North America forever.In this magisterial first solus book, tying into the 250th anniversary of the battle, Dan Snow tells the story of this famous campaign which was to have far-reaching consequences for Britain&#39;s rise to global hegemony, and the world at large. Snow brilliantly sets the battle within its global context and tells a gripping tale of brutal war quite unlike any fought in Europe, where terrain, weather and native Canadian tribes were as fearsome as any enemy. `I never served so disagreeable a campaign as this,&#39; grumbled one British commander, `it is war of the worst shape.&#39;1759 was, without question, a year in which the decisions of men changed the world forever. Based on original research and told from all perspectives, this is history - military, political, human - on an epic scale.</p><p>Dan Snow is a young historian who has researched, written and presented a number of documentaries on British and world history for the BBC, including the BAFTA award-winning `Battlefield Britain&#39;. He has contributed to BBC History Magazine, The Times, the Guardian, the Express and the Sunday Times. He is a Canadian citizen and is the son of BBC journalist Peter Snow.&#39;Many of us wondered whether Dan Snow could make the transition from fluent TV presenter to serious historian. This hugely impressive work confirms his triumphant arrival on the scene. It is by far the best account yet written of a campaign that helped shape North America, and is a fitting tribute on the 250th anniversary of that &#34;wonderful year&#34; 1759&#39; Richard Holmes&#34;Dan Snow is perhaps more familiar from television....this, his first book, proves him to be a master military historian in the making. Its grasp of detail is prodigious&#34; Daily Express&#34;Lively and thoughtful...fascinating stuff....one of the book&#39;s strengths is its vivid portrayal of the physical backdrop against which the campaign unfolded&#34; Literary Review</p><h2>John Blakemore&#39;s Black and White Photography Workshop</h2><p>Bringing his vast knowledge and experience to bear, John Blakemore explores the creative as well as the technical processes involved in black and white photography. Long awaited for the many thousands of photographers that have attended his legendary workshops over the years and essential for the many more that have never had the chance, this is a unique insight into the art of one of photography&#39;s most influential practitioners and an important document of the methods of one of photography&#39;s most important teachers.</p><p>Starting as a freelance photographer in 1956, John Blakemore soon emerged as England's leading landscape photographer, later transferring his unique and elegant photographic style into areas as diverse as still life, documentary, portraiture and Polaroid colour. His work is included in the public collections of, among others, the Royal Photographic Society, the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, the Arts Council of Great Britian, the Los Angeles County Museum, the Fotografiska Museet, Stokholm, and the British Council. He has had one-man exhibitions all over the world including in London, LA and New York, and a British Council Touring Exhibition to Eastern Europe, South America and China. He has had four monographs of his work published, and has given public workshops for over 25 years establishing himself as one of the UK's best known photography teachers. He also taught photography at the University of Derby for many years and, recently retired, is now Emeritus Professor of Photography.

We are not pawns of global determinism, but with a few basic collective reforms and a return to individual self-reliance instead of our current self-obsessions, we can rebuild a prosperous, fair, and dynamic American culture and civilization. An outsider/insider message of hope and renewal that is now as rare as it is needed." Author: Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow, the Hoover Institution, Stanford University<br><br>"David Bahnsen has written a bracing and incisive critique of our increasingly pervasive culture of victimization. He makes a compelling case that it's still within our power, and absolutely necessary, that we help ourselves. You will enjoy and profit from this book." Author: Rich Lowry, Editor-in-Chief, National Review<br><br>"When will we put our fingers to better use than pointing them at each other or thrusting a middle one into the air? David Bahnsen shows us how to use our hands and brains to improve housing, education, labor markets, tax policy, and more." Author: Dr. Marvin Olasky, World editor-in-chief<br><br>"In any debate, the one who controls the narrative, wins the day and David Bahnsen is about shifting the narrative on discussions related to doing well and good at the same time. Bahnsen has undertaken this herculean task in&nbsp;<i>Crisis of Responsibility&nbsp;</i>by combining his economic and financial acumen with his moral clarity in a manner that is neither didactic nor preachy. See if you don't agree."&nbsp; Author: Fr. Robert Sirico, President, The Acton Institute<br><br>"Markets are living moral creatures, as David Bahnsen notes. The world has been waiting for someone from finance to address the moral aspect of the 2008 crisis. Dave 'Moral Hazard' Bahnsen delivers it." Author: Amity Shlaes, Board Chair, Coolidge Presidential Foundation<br><br>"The philosopher Johann Herder once defined culture as 'the lifeblood of a people; the flow of moral energy that keeps a society intact.' If that analysis is correct, then we can respond that our society has been definitively exsanguinated. For this reason, I am so glad David Bahnsen's book has made its way to the public&#x2014;for such a time as this. From Wall Street to Main Street and from tech to trade, Bahnsen diagnoses the fundamental problem that ails us and prescribes the only possible cure. He chronicles the decline of individual responsibility while simultaneously offering concrete proposals to bring it back to the nation." Author: Dr. Gregory Thornbury, President King's College<br><br>"In his thought-provoking, brilliant new book, David Bahnsen brings to light, in an easy to read style, the necessary components for building and maintaining a prosperous and moral society. Personal responsibility, opportunity, and limited government are cornerstones for success for all Americans. It is a must read." Author: Sally Pipes, President, Pacific Research Institute<br><br>"Bahnsen has produced the quintessential counter-narrative to both the 2008 financial collapse and the 2016 presidential election. The theme of both individual and institutional responsibility was a major driving force behind the founding of our nation, and it was a guiding principle until at least halfway through the 20th century. Its evaporation in recent decades has dramatically altered our culture. Bahnsen exposes this crisis and shows us the way out of it. I eagerly endorse this book, but I must say that the most telling endorsement is nothing I could say, but rather the author himself, whom I have known for 20 years as the epitome of individual responsibility. This man practices what he preaches. It is principally for this reason that I urge you to listen to his preaching: the more David Bahnsens that emerge, the fewer cultural crises we would suffer."&nbsp; Author: P. Andrew Sandlin, Founder &amp; President, Center for Cultural Leadership<br><br>"I found&nbsp;<i>Crisis of Responsibility&nbsp;</i>a remarkable and urgent synthesis of the economic, social, and cultural afflictions of modern America. But I was also heartened by the commitment to solving these problems through common sense and a renewal of individual responsibility. I hope this book finds a large and appreciative audience. It deserves to."

All the stories deal with the author&#39;s early experiences working each summer for the Forestry Commission.</p><p><br><strong>Norman Maclean</strong> (1902-1990), woodsman, scholar, teacher, and storyteller, grew up in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana. As a young man, he&nbsp;worked in logging camps and for the United States Forest Service. He was awarded&nbsp;an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. He was the William Rainey Harper Professor of English at the University of Chicago, teaching the Romantic poets and Shakespeare.&nbsp;After his retirement in 1973, he began to write the stories he liked to tell, which became the book <em>A River Runs Through It and Other Stories</em>, published to widespread acclaim. The book was the first work of original fiction published by the University of Chicago Press. It was nominated by a selection committee to receive the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977, but the full committee ignored the nomination and did not award a Pulitzer in that category for the year. In the last years of his life, he wrote an account of the 1949 Mann Gulch forest fire. It was published posthumously as <em>Young Men and Fire</em>, and won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1992.<br>Norman Maclean wrote this work to preserve memories of his late brother, but it's not exactly a memoir or biography. The people are real, but the way the memories bend with the passage of years is evident, Maclean's son notes, since his father penned it after retirement. Ivan Doig reads this tale of male bonding on a Montana river with the personal touch that Maclean himself gave it. This edition includes "On the Big Blackfoot," a disc that includes writing fragments of Maclean, his son's memories of him, and an interview with the author. The bonus disc is well produced, but since it is fragments, it may disappoint those already familiar with the earlier work.

Peter T. Hooper is bored to bits by his mother's habit of always making scrambled eggs out of hen's eggs. "And so," he informs his friend Liz, "I decided that, just for a change, I'd scramble a new kind of egg on the range." We're off on an epic journey to parts (and birds) unknown, all told in classic head-over-heels Seussian style: "Then I went for some Ziffs. They're exactly like Zuffs. But the Ziffs live on cliffs and the Zuffs live on bluffs." Finally, after capturing a small mountain of different types of egg--from Moth-Watching Sneths, Long-Legger Kwongs, and others--it's back to the kitchen for a 99-pan scramble, with all sorts of bizarre ingredients added just for fun. To be precise, it's time for "Scrambled eggs Super-Dee-Dooper-Dee-Booper, Special deluxe a-la-Peter T. Hooper." Somehow, you get the impression that Liz doesn't believe a word of it.

That quiet sale, which raised the possibility that there were other vintage prints of Mike Disfarmer's work in area family albums, set off a competitive buying frenzy that had collectors going door to door through rural Arkansas, spending more than a million dollars on several thousand prints. Disfarmer's work had originally been discovered in crates of glass-plate negatives, found by the speculator who purchased his estate. It was brought to light decades later in a series of books and exhibitions that set off consistent, continuing critical acclaim, but known only in posthumous reprints. <i>Original Disfarmer Photographs</i> is the first publication to present these vintage prints, made by Disfarmer's own hand at the time the pictures were taken--at once family mementos and the original work of one of America's greatest portraitists. Disfarmer spent half a century making studio portraits at pennies a picture to satisfy his rural clients, and creating a style of portraiture all his own.

For 159 days they wandered through the wilderness in the four-corners region of the Southwest, experiencing many trials and tribulations. They ran out of food and were forced to eat several of their horses. Most of the time the expedition was technically lost and they never did find their way to California, but they explored a vast new land and made remarkably accurate maps. It was a memorable adventure that they recorded in detail in their diaries. <p>Using these diaries, Ken Reyher, the author, physically retraced the 1700-mile route so that he would know firsthand the land they traveled through and the reasons they made the decisions they did. Unlike previous books on the expedition, Reyher focuses on the adventure as well as the historical events along the way. The result is an accurate history that reads more like a fast paced novel.</p></p><p></p><h2>Meeting at the Crossroads</h2><p>"Should sound a national alert to society that even our most privileged girls still pursue normal femininity at great risk to personal and civic health."<br>THE BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE<br>Lyn Mike Brown and Carol Gilligan ask "What, on the way to womanhood, does a girl give up?" One hundred girls gave voice to what is rarely spoken and often ignored: that the passage out of girlhood is a journey into silence and disconnection, a troubled crossing when a girl loses a firm sense of self and becomes tentative and unsure. These changes mark the endge of adolescence as a watershed in women's psychological development and the stories the girls tell are by turns heartrending and courageous. Listening to these girls provides us with the means of reaching out to them at this critical time, and of better understanding what we as women and men may have left behind at our own crossroads.<br>A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR</p><p><b>Lyn Mikel Brown</b> is Associate Professor of Education and Human Development at Colby College.</p><h2>Hamilton: The Revolution</h2><p><b>Winner, 2017 APA Audie Awards - Audiobook of the Year</b><br><br>Lin-Manuel Miranda's groundbreaking musical, <i>Hamilton</i>, is as revolutionary as its subject: the poor kid from the Caribbean who fought the British, defended the Constitution, and helped to found the United States. Fusing hip-hop, pop, R&amp;B, and the best traditions of theater, this once-in-a-generation show broadens the sound of Broadway, reveals the storytelling power of rap, and claims our country's origins for a diverse new generation. <br><br><i>Hamilton: The Revolution</i> gives listeners an unprecedented insight into both revolutions, from the only two writers able to provide it. Miranda, along with Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic and theater artist who was involved in the project from its earliest stages - "since before this was even a show," according to Miranda - traces its development from an improbable performance at the White House to its landmark opening night on Broadway six years later. In addition, Emmy and Gold Globe-winning actor Mariska Hargitay lends her voice to the audiobook, and Miranda reads more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is included in the PDF with this audiobook. <br><br>The audiobook does more than tell the surprising story of how a Broadway musical became a national phenomenon: It demonstrates that America has always been renewed by the brash upstarts and brilliant outsiders, the men and women who don't throw away their shots. <br><br>"Mariska, in addition to being the number-one fan of the show, represents, to me, much of what <i>Hamilton</i> is about - tough, smart, and New York. She's an essential part of this city; it feels only right for her to narrate the story." (Lin-Manuel Miranda)<br><br></p><p><b>Jeremy McCarter </b>wrote cultural criticism for <i>New York</i> magazine and <i>Newsweek </i>before spending five years on the artistic staff of the Public Theater, where he created, directed, and produced the Public Forum series. He served on the jury of the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and is writing a book about young American radicals during World War One. He lives in Chicago. <br><br> <b>Lin-Manuel Miranda</b> <i>(Book, Music, and Lyrics/Alexander Hamilton)</i> is the Tony and Grammy award-winning composer-lyricist-star of Broadway's <i>In the Heights</i>--winner of four 2008 Tony Awards including Best Musical, Best Orchestrations, and Best Choreography with Miranda receiving the award for Best Score. Additionally, he is the co-composer and co-lyricist of Broadway's Tony-nominated <i>Bring It On: The Musical </i>and provided Spanish translations for the 2009 Broadway revival of <i>West Side Story</i>. Miranda, along with Tom Kitt, won the 2014 Creative Arts Emmy for Best Original Music and Lyrics for their work on the 67th Annual Tony Awards. In 2015, Miranda was named as a Fellow of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He lives with his family in New York City.This glorious, oversize testament to the multiple Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton is a joy to anyone who loves the sound track or who has been lucky enough to score tickets to the show. Miranda's annotations are in the margins of the lyrics, which are usually overlaid on full-spread photographs of the cast. He explains the many homages to rappers of his youth, as well as why he used literary devices, changed music tempos, and added fiction when Ron Chernow's biography couldn't fill in the gaps. Thirty-two essays offer teens even more background knowledge of how the show was created and often include lyrics that were cut from the final show. Through interviews with cast members and mentors, readers will be engrossed in the narrative and listening along to the sound track. The line "Immigrants: We get the job done," from "Yorktown (the World Turned Upside Down)," stirs rousing applause during performances, and the revolutionary twist of nonwhite actors portraying the Founding Fathers will be inspiring to young people.

As the book proceeds through adolescence, middle age, old age, he juxtaposes biological details with bits of philosophical speculation, cultural history and criticism, and quotations from a wide range of writers and thinkers&#x2014;from Lucretius to Woody Allen&#x2014;yielding a magical whole: the universal story of our bodily being, a tender and often hilarious portrait of one family.<br><br>A book of extraordinary depth and resonance, <i>The Thing About Life Is That One Day You&#x2019;ll Be Dead </i>will move readers to contemplate the brevity and radiance of their own sojourn on earth and challenge them to rearrange their thinking in unexpected and crucial ways.</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, February 2008: </b> "After you turn 7, your risk of dying doubles every eight years." By your 80s, you "no longer even have a distinctive odor ... You're vanishing." "The brain of a 90-year-old is the same size as that of a 3-year-old." And it goes on and on. David Shields's litany of decay and decrepitude might have overwhelmed the age-sensitive reader (like this one), but <i>The Thing About Life Is That One Day You'll Be Dead</i> manages to transcend the maudlin by melding personal history with frank biological data about every stage of life, creating an "autobiography about my body" that seeks meaning in death, but moreover, life. Shields filters his frank--and usually foreboding--data through his own experience as a 51-year-old father with burgeoning back pain, contrasting his own gloomy tendencies with the defiant perspective of his own 97-year-old father, a man who has waged a lifelong, urgent battle against the infirmities of time. (If believed, his love life at age 70 was truly marvelous.) Interwoven with observations of philosophers from Cicero and Sophocles to Lauren Bacall and Woody Allen ("I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve immortality through not dying."), Shields's book is a surprisingly moving and life-affirming embrace of the human condition, where inevitable failures and frailties become "thrilling" and "liberating," rather than dour portents of The End. <i>--Jon Foro</i> <br><br> <br> <b>Amazon.com Guest Review: Danielle Trussoni</b><br> David Shields's <i>The Thing About Life is that One Day You&#x2019;ll Be Dead</i> is an addictively punchy, startlingly brilliant exploration of our most essential relationship--the one between parent and child. Shields juxtaposes a storm of astonishing facts about the development of the human body ("By the time you're 5, your head has attained 90 percent of its mature size; by 7, your brain reaches 90 percent of its maximum weight; by 9, 95 percent; during adolescence, 100 percent") with an intimate portrait of himself as a son and father. The result is a naked, honest, and often funny book that forces one to look clearly at the realities of the body--especially the burden that biology imposes upon our inner life--in a fresh and disturbing way. The writing is fast, postmodern, and filled with quotations from such diverse sources as Shields's back doctor and Tolstoy. The style might be dizzying in the hands of a less perceptive narrator, but Shields has the eye of an archeologist cataloging the bizarre traits of an ancient civilization. How Shields managed to compress the whole mess of love, family, genetics, and desire into this elegant, elemental book is a wonder. --Danielle Trussoni, author of <i>Falling Through the Earth: A Memoir</i> <br><br><b>David Shields</b> is the author of eight previous books of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Black Planet</i> (a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award), <i>Remote</i> (winner of the PEN/Revson Award), and <i>Dead Languages</i> (winner of the PEN Syndicated Fiction Award).

That the injustice was repaired by that collection was happily affirmed by its subsequent success. The range of writing--from the technical to the aphoristic/diaristic--demonstrated that sometimes critical writing on music can inspire as much as it can explicate.

Now <i>Arcana II</i>, also edited by Zorn, extends the scope of its predecessor, compiling further essential writing by luminaries of contemporary improvisation and composition such as Butch Morris, Evan Parker, Marina Rosenfeld, Ned Rothenberg, Sylvie Courvoisier, Steve Coleman, Dave Douglas, Annie Gosfield, Jim O'Rourke, Milford Graves, Zeena Parkins, Bill Laswell and Uri Caine.</p><p></p><h2>Living Sanibel: A Nature Guide to Sanibel &amp; Captiva Islands</h2><p>Living Sanibel is the most complete nature guide to Sanibel and Captiva Island ever compiled.

It sounds like Shakespeare and it could have very well been the plot of one of his plays." <br>-<i>-Toronto Star</i><br><i></i></p><p>In <i>1494, </i>award-winning author Stephen R. Bown tells the untold story of the explosive feud between monarchs, clergy, and explorers that split the globe between Spain and Portugal and made the world's oceans a battleground.<br>When Columbus triumphantly returned from America to Spain in 1493, his discoveries inflamed an already-smouldering conflict between Spain's renowned monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, and Portugal's Joï¿½o II. Which nation was to control the world's oceans? To quell the argument, Pope Alexander VI&#x2015;the notorious Rodrigo Borgia&#x2015;issued a proclamation laying the foundation for the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, an edict that created an imaginary line in the Atlantic Ocean dividing the entire known (and unknown) world between Spain and Portugal. <br>Just as the world's oceans were about to be opened by Columbus's epochal voyage, the treaty sought to limit the seas to these two favored Catholic nations. The edict was to have a profound influence on world history: it propelled Spain and Portugal to superpower status, steered many other European nations on a collision course, and became the central grievance in two centuries of international espionage, piracy, and warfare. <br>The treaty also began the fight for "the freedom of the seas"&#x2015;the epic struggle to determine whether the world's oceans, and thus global commerce, would be controlled by the decree of an autocrat or be open to the ships of any nation&#x2015;a distinctly modern notion, championed in the early seventeenth century by the Dutch legal theorist Hugo Grotius, whose arguments became the foundation of international law.<br>At the heart of one of the greatest international diplomatic and political agreements of the last five centuries were the strained relationships and passions of a handful of powerful individuals. They were linked by a shared history, mutual animosity, and personal obligations&#x2015;quarrels, rivalries, and hatreds that dated back decades. Yet the struggle ultimately stemmed from a young woman's determination to defy tradition and the king, and to choose her own husband.</p></p><p><p>STEPHEN R.

The younger half-sister to Enrique, the reigning king of Castile, Isabella found the king's first choice for her husband, the aging and grasping king of Portugal, Afonso V, to be unpleasant. Although a renowned warrior and crusader who a decade earlier had beaten back the Moors from Morocco, Afonso was now more than twice Isabella's age and already had an adult son who would be his heir. He had grown plump and unappealing as well as politically impotent--a disadvantage for any children that might arise from the union. He was also related to Isabella, a reality not uncommon in dynastic marriages in Europe in the late Middle Ages, but nonetheless requiring a papal dispensation. The thought of this man as her lifelong bedmate and as the father of her children was enough to make Isabella weep.But Isabella's marriage was a matter of state interest; from Enrique's point of view, romance or compatibility had little to dowith it. Enrique was in favour of the match, and so was Afonso. In fact, the two men had been discussing the betrothal for a few years, and the proposal had been firmly yet diplomatically resisted by Isabella for just as long. At one point the stubborn princess had informed her half-brother that she "could not be disposed of in marriage without the consent of the nobles of the realm," which was an accurate if audacious claim. Enrique knew that consent from his nobles would not be readily forthcoming in the current complicated political climate, particularly if Isabella chose to cause trouble. But the pressure from Portugal to meet the proposal, and his own need for Portuguese military support, was so great that Enrique eventually threatened Isabella with imprisonment in the Alcï¿½zar in Madrid if she refused to agree to the marriage.A Portuguese courtier implied that Portuguese armies would march on Castile in retaliation if she persisted in her humiliating refusal. Isabella may have appeared passive--she was fond of reading and devoted to lengthy prayer sessions--but years of dangerous court intrigue had made her a master dissembler. Although her placid smile conveyed a disarming neutrality, she had her own plans and dreams, held close to her heart and shared only with her closest supporters and advisers. Those dreams did not correspond with the wishes of her king and many of the grandees of the realm. Known to history for having a strong and independent will throughout her life, Isabella made it abundantly clear in 1468 while still a teenager that she would not have the repulsive Portuguese monarch as her consort and spouse, regardless of the consequences. Her exasperating display of independence was threatening to derail plans that had been years in the making, and possibly to agitate the fragile peace between the two nations.Enrique considered his options. He consulted with his advisers and explored other possibilities for Isabella's marriage. His half-sister's marriage had become a personal as well as political concern. Isabella's claim to the Castilian throne, were Enrique todie suddenly, was now stronger even than the claim of his own six-year-old daughter, Juana. Named after her mother, the vivacious Juana of Portugal, his daughter coincidentally was the niece of the Portuguese King Afonso-Enrique's wife, Juana of Portugal, was Afonso's younger sister. But the younger Juana was widely suspected to have been sired by one of Enrique's court favourites, the dashing Beltrï¿½n de la Cueva, and therefore illegitimate for purposes of political inheritance. In fact Enrique, at the strenuous urging of his nobles following several years of simmering civil war, had recently made a public proclamation that Juana was not his offspring. The unfortunate girl was nicknamed "La Beltraneja," a name that stuck with her not only throughout her life but down through the centuries. It did not help his position that his queen had recently given birth to yet another child who could not possibly have been sired by Enrique because the royal couple had been living in different places. Despite the great efforts made to conceal the pregnancy with tight gowns, the impropriety had been discovered. It was now widely claimed in the Castilian court that the queen "has not used her person cleanly, as comports with her duty as servant to the king."The marriage was duly annulled by the papal legate, and the oaths of allegiance to Juana that Enrique had extracted from his nobles were likewise annulled. Owing to the child's acknowledged illegitimacy, and lacking direct legitimate descendants, the thirty-eight-year-old Enrique, snidely known as "the Impotent," had little choice but to name his half-sister, Isabella, as the princess of Asturias, next in line to succeed to the throne of Castile as the one true heir. But he had forced a concession from her: he would have the authority to choose her husband.Isabella's marriage could not be considered lightly, but Enrique's motives were less than noble. He wished to give the appearance of selecting a suitable mate for her while neutralizing her political potential in Castile, and eventually to undermine herclaim to his throne. Enrique briefly pursued several other marriage matches for Isabella, including to the duke of Gloucester, the future King Richard III, in distant and chilly England, and the French king Louis XI'S brother, the effete Charles, duke of Berry and Guienne. An alliance with France, sealed and secured with a marriage, might allow Castile and France to surround the smaller kingdom of Aragon and perhaps claim some outlying territories.Although Charles was only five years her senior and at that time the heir to the French throne, Isabella was not enamoured with him. No newcomer to intrigue, Isabella had sent her confidante, Friar Alfonso de Coca, to France to spy on him. The friar returned with a depressing report. The young French noble seemed prematurely aged. He was, according to de Coca, "made ugly by the extremely misshapen thin legs and watery eyes that were sometimes so bad as to be nearly blind, so that rather than weapons and a horse what he needed was a skilful guide." Charles was certainly not the man to quicken Isabella's heart.But de Coca made another interesting discovery. He had also travelled to the neighbouring kingdom of Aragon to spy on one further marital option that had been secretly urged upon Isabella by her personal political adviser Alfonso Carillo de Acuï¿½a, the archbishop of Toledo: Ferdinand, the sixteen-year-old son and heir to King Juan II of Aragon. De Coca was pleased to inform Isabella that this young prince had "a gallant presence that could not be compared to the Duke [of Berry] ... he has a singular grace that everyone who talks to him wants to serve him." Young Ferdinand was also a skilled swordsman and field commander, talents that might prove valuable should Isabella defy Enrique and proceed with a betrothal. Muscular and athletic, Ferdinand was "a great rider of the bridle and the jennet, and a great lance thrower and other activities which he performed with great skill and a grace," according to a later court historian. He also had "marvellously beautiful, large slightly slanted eyes, thin eyebrows, a sharpnose that fit the shape and size of his face." His mouth was "often laughing" and his build "most appropriate to elegant suits and the finest clothes." It was hardly surprising when Isabella pronounced to Carillo that "it must be he and no other."A match with Ferdinand of Aragon was sure to be opposed by Enrique and many of his loyal nobles, as it would strengthen rather than weaken Isabella's claim to the Castilian throne. (Despite his public proclamation, Enrique still schemed to pass the throne to his daughter Juana.) Any children Isabella and Ferdinand might have would be joint heirs to the thrones of both Castile and Aragon, uniting most of the Iberian peninsula in one royal house and possibly overshadowing Portugal.Isabella's stubbornness was balanced by her sense of duty and piety, but geopolitics and the national interests of Castile--at least, Enrique's idea of Castile's interests--could only sway her so far. She urged her small cadre of supporters and advisers to begin secret marriage negotiations with Ferdinand. Given the possible domestic outcomes for the lonely teenage princess--her father was long dead, her mother descended into melancholy and madness and her younger brother recently poisoned to death--Isabella seems to have demonstrated remarkable courage in defying the king and choosing her mate, and therefore determining Castile's future political alliances. Despite her feelings of guilt at betraying her half-brother's trust--though she knew by now that he did not have her best interests at heart--she had to proceed quickly with her plan. Enrique, who was away from his court to suppress an uprising in Andalusia, would certainly marshal forces to prevent any union with Ferdinand and perhaps even imprison Isabella or quickly marry her off to either the duke of Berry or King Afonso. Enrique had not yet accepted as final her refusal to obey him.While Isabella's supporters--powerful aristocrats who were working to ensure her ultimate position as queen of Castile--proceeded with the touchy marriage negotiations with Ferdinand'sfather, Juan vi, king of Aragon, Isabella waited in her castle in Valladolid. The negotiations proceeded slowly as each communication had to be carted in secret across the plains and mountains by riders on horses, a journey that could take a week between the two kingdoms. A diplomatic marriage at this high level, involving the possible heir to the Castilian throne and the heir to the Aragonese throne, involved a great deal of politics concerning the workings of the kingdoms under a joint monarchy and cou...</p><h2>A Model World and Other Stories</h2><p><p>By the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay.</em></p>This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.</p><p><p> Michael Chabon is the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the <i>Mysteries of Pittsburgh</i>, <i>A Model World</i>, <i>Wonder Boys</i>, <i>Werewolves In Their Youth</i>, <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</i>, <i>The Final Solution</i>, <i>The Yiddish Policemen&#x2019;s Union</i>, <i>Maps &amp; Legends</i>, <i>Gentlemen of the Road</i>, and the middle-grade book <i>Summerland</i>. </p> <p> He lives in Berkeley, California, with his wife, the novelist Ayelet Waldman, and their children. </p>This collection of 11 stories by the author of the well-received Mysteries of Pittsburgh (Morrow, 1988) should help cement Chabon's status as one of the best of America's young fiction writers. Each of the stories concerns an individual's adaptation to a changed relationship, be it with wife (or ex-wife), friend, lover, or parent. Particularly evocative are the five final stories which fall under the rubric "The Lost World." They deal with a boy's response to his parents' divorce and their subsequent attempts to establish new partnerships. Chabon writes with intelligence, humor, and an obvious love of language. In the first story's marvelous opening paragraph, the protagonist goes from performing his toilet "with patience, hope, and a ruthless punctilic" to sitting in the back at his cousin's wedding "awash in a nostalgic tedium . . . wishing for irretrievable things." It leaves one hoping that, like Dr. Shapiro in "More Than Human," Chabon never surrenders his love for "the soothing foolishness of words." If he keeps developing, he will become a major force in American fiction. Essential for all public and academic libraries. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 12/90.<br><i>- David W.

It is the work of one of the world's most distinguished writers.<br><br>Tony Webster and his clique first met Adrian Finn at school. Sex-hungry and book-hungry, they navigated the girl drought of gawky adolescence together, trading in affectations, in-jokes, rumour and wit. Maybe Adrian was a little more serious than the others, certainly more intelligent, but they swore to stay friends forever. Until Adrian's life took a turn into tragedy, and all of them, especially Tony, moved on and did their best to forget.<br><br>Now Tony is in middle age. He's had a career and a marriage, a calm divorce. He gets along nicely, he thinks, with his one child, a daughter, and even with his ex-wife. He's certainly never tried to hurt anybody. Memory, though, is imperfect. It can always throw up surprises, as a lawyer's letter is about to prove.

And I&#x2019;m not referring to theories about how it bends and doubles back, or may exist elsewhere in parallel versions. No, I mean ordinary, everyday time, which clocks and watches assure us passes regularly: tick-tock, click-clock. Is there anything more plausible than a second hand? And yet it takes only the smallest pleasure or pain to teach us time&#x2019;s malleability. Some emotions speed it up, others slow it down; occasionally, it seems to go missing &#x2013; until the eventual point when it really does go missing, never to return.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m not very interested in my schooldays, and don&#x2019;t feel any nostalgia for them. But school is where it all began, so I need to return briefly to a few incidents that have grown into anecdotes, to some approximate memories which time has deformed into certainty. If I can&#x2019;t be sure of the actual events any more, I can at least be true to the impressions those facts left. That&#x2019;s the best I can manage.<br>&nbsp;<br>There were three of us, and he now made the fourth. We hadn&#x2019;t expected to add to our tight number: cliques and pairings had happened long before, and we were already beginning to imagine our escape from school into life. His name was Adrian Finn, a tall, shy boy who initially kept his eyes down and his mind to himself. For the first day or two, we took little notice of him: at our school there was no welcoming ceremony, let alone its opposite, the punitive induction. We just registered his presence and waited.<br>&nbsp;<br>The masters were more interested in him than we were. They had to work out his intelligence and sense of discipline, calculate how well he&#x2019;d previously been taught, and if he might prove &#x2018;scholarship material&#x2019;. On the third morning of that autumn term, we had a history class with Old Joe Hunt, wryly affable in his three-piece suit, a teacher whose system of control depended on maintaining sufficient but not excessive boredom.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Now, you&#x2019;ll remember that I asked you to do some preliminary reading about the reign of Henry VIII.&#x2019; Colin, Alex and I squinted at one another, hoping that the question wouldn&#x2019;t be flicked, like an angler&#x2019;s fl y, to land on one of our heads. &#x2018;Who might like to offer a characterisation of the age?&#x2019; He drew his own conclusion from our averted eyes. &#x2018;Well, Marshall, perhaps. How would you describe Henry VIII&#x2019;s reign?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Our relief was greater than our curiosity, because Marshall was a cautious know-nothing who lacked the inventiveness of true ignorance. He searched for possible hidden complexities in the question before eventually locating a response.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;There was unrest, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>An outbreak of barely controlled smirking; Hunt himself almost smiled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Would you, perhaps, care to elaborate?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Marshall nodded slow assent, thought a little longer, and decided it was no time for caution. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d say there was great unrest, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Finn, then. Are you up in this period?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>The new boy was sitting a row ahead and to my left. He had shown no evident reaction to Marshall&#x2019;s idiocies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Not really, sir, I&#x2019;m afraid. But there is one line of thought according to which all you can truly say of any historical event &#x2013; even the outbreak of the First World War, for example &#x2013; is that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d;.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Is there, indeed? Well, that would put me out of a job, wouldn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; After some sycophantic laughter, Old Joe Hunt pardoned our holiday idleness and filled us in on the polygamous royal butcher.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the next break, I sought out Finn. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Tony Webster.&#x2019; He looked at me warily. &#x2018;Great line to Hunt.&#x2019; He seemed not to know what I was referring to. &#x2018;About something happening.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Oh. Yes. I was rather disappointed he didn&#x2019;t take it up.&#x2019; That wasn&#x2019;t what he was supposed to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another detail I remember: the three of us, as a symbol of our bond, used to wear our watches with the face on the inside of the wrist. It was an affectation, of course, but perhaps something more. It made time feel like a personal, even a secret, thing. We expected Adrian to note the gesture, and follow suit; but he didn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later that day &#x2013; or perhaps another day &#x2013; we had a double English period with Phil Dixon, a young master just down from Cambridge. He liked to use contemporary texts, and would throw out sudden challenges. &#x2018; &#x201c;Birth, and Copulation, and Death&#x201d; &#x2013; that&#x2019;s what T. S. Eliot says it&#x2019;s all about. Any comments?&#x2019; He once compared a Shakespearean hero to Kirk Douglas in <i>Spartacus</i>. And I remember how, when we were discussing Ted Hughes&#x2019;s poetry, he put his head at a donnish slant and murmured, &#x2018;Of course, we&#x2019;re all wondering what will happen when he runs out of animals.&#x2019; Sometimes, he addressed us as &#x2018;Gentlemen&#x2019;. Naturally, we adored him. That afternoon, he handed out a poem with no title, date or author&#x2019;s name, gave us ten minutes to study it, then asked for our responses.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Shall we start with you, Finn? Put simply, what would you say this poem is <i>about</i>?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Adrian looked up from his desk. &#x2018;Eros and Thanatos, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Hmm. Go on.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Sex and death,&#x2019; Finn continued, as if it might not just be the thickies in the back row who didn&#x2019;t understand Greek. &#x2018;Or love and death, if you prefer. The erotic principle, in any case, coming into conflict with the death principle. And what ensues from that conflict. Sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was probably looking more impressed than Dixon thought healthy.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Webster, enlighten us further.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I just thought it was a poem about a barn owl, sir.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>This was one of the differences between the three of us and our new friend. We were essentially taking the piss, except when we were serious. He was essentially serious, except when he was taking the piss. It took us a while to work this out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Adrian allowed himself to be absorbed into our group, without acknowledging that it was something he sought. Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t. Nor did he alter his views to accord with ours. At morning prayers he could be heard joining in the responses while Alex and I merely mimed the words, and Colin preferred the satirical ploy of the pseudo-zealot&#x2019;s enthusiastic bellow. The three of us considered school sports a crypto-fascist plan for repressing our sex-drive; Adrian joined the fencing club and did the high jump. We were belligerently tone-deaf; he came to school with his clarinet. When Colin denounced the family, I mocked the political system, and Alex made philosophical objections to the perceived nature of reality, Adrian kept his counsel &#x2013; at first, anyway. He gave the impression that he believed in things. We did too &#x2013; it was just that we wanted to believe in our own things, rather than what had been decided for us.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hence what we thought of as our cleansing scepticism. The school was in central London, and each day we travelled up to it from our separate boroughs, passing from one system of control to another. Back then, things were plainer: less money, no electronic devices, little fashion tyranny, no girlfriends. There was nothing to distract us from our human and filial duty which was to study, pass exams, use those qualifications to find a job, and then put together a way of life unthreateningly fuller than that of our parents, who would approve, while privately comparing it to their own earlier lives, which had been simpler, and therefore superior. None of this, of course, was ever stated: the genteel social Darwinism of the English middle classes always remained implicit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Fucking bastards, parents,&#x2019; Colin complained one Monday lunchtime. &#x2018;You think they&#x2019;re OK when you&#x2019;re little, then you realise they&#x2019;re just like . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Henry VIII, Col?&#x2019; Adrian suggested. We were beginning to get used to his sense of irony; also to the fact that it might be turned against us as well. When teasing, or calling us to seriousness, he would address me as Anthony; Alex would become Alexander, and the unlengthenable Colin shortened to Col.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if my dad had half a dozen wives.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And was incredibly rich.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And painted by Holbein.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;And told the Pope to sod off.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Any particular reason why they&#x2019;re FBs?&#x2019; Alex asked Colin.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;I wanted us to go to the funfair. They said they had to spend the weekend gardening.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term &#x2018;singleparent family&#x2019; came into use; back then it was &#x2018;a broken home&#x2019;, and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from one. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn&#x2019;t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family &#x2013; or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.<br>&nbsp;<br>In those days, we imagined ourselves as being kept in some kind of holding pen, waiting to be released into our lives. And when that moment came, our lives &#x2013; and time itself &#x2013; would speed up. How were we to know that our lives had in any case begun, that some advantage had already been gained, some damage already inflicted? Also, that our release would only be into a larger holding pen, whose boundaries would be at first undiscernible.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the meantime, we were book-hungry, sex-hungry, meritocratic, anarchistic. All political and social systems appeared to us corrupt, yet we declined to consider an alternative other than hedonistic chaos. Adrian, however, pushed us to believe in the application of thought to life, in the notion that principles should guide actions. Previously, Alex had been regarded as the philosopher among us. He had read stuff the other two hadn&#x2019;t, and might, for instance, suddenly declare, &#x2018;Whereof we cannot speak, thereof must we remain silent.&#x2019; Colin and I would consider this idea in silence for a while, then grin and carry on talking. But now Adrian&#x2019;s arrival dislodged Alex from his position &#x2013; or rather, gave us another choice of philosopher. If Alex had read Russell and Wittgenstein, Adrian had read Camus and Nietzsche. I had read George Orwell and Aldous Huxley; Colin had read Baudelaire and Dostoevsky. This is only a slight caricature.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yes, of course we were pretentious &#x2013; what else is youth for? We used terms like &#x2018;<i>Weltanschauung</i>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<i>Sturm und Drang</i>&#x2019;, enjoyed saying &#x2018;That&#x2019;s philosophically self-evident&#x2019;, and assured one another that the imagination&#x2019;s first duty was to be transgressive. Our parents saw things differently, picturing their children as innocents suddenly exposed to noxious influence. So Colin&#x2019;s mother referred to me as his &#x2018;dark angel&#x2019;; my father blamed Alex when he found me reading <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>; Colin was fingered by Alex&#x2019;s parents when they caught him with a hard-boiled American crime novel. And so on. It was the same with sex. Our parents thought we might be corrupted by one another into becoming whatever it was they most feared: an incorrigible masturbator, a winsome homosexual, a recklessly impregnatory libertine. On our behalf they dreaded the closeness of adolescent friendship, the predatory behaviour of strangers on trains, the lure of the wrong kind of girl. How far their anxieties outran our experience.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>A Room of My Own: A Novel</h2><p>Virginia, the daughter of a wealthy physician, lived in an idyllic world until the Great Depression hit, and when she finds herself alongside her father giving medical aid and assistance to the community, she begins to learn the true lessons of life</p><p><b>Ann Tatlock</b> is a full-time writer who has also worked as an assistant editor for Decision Magazine.

Rabbi Firestone teaches and lectures widely on Jewish meditation and practices. She lives in Boulder with her husband, David, and their three children.Firestone's autobiography has all the suspense and excitement of a good novel as it details her complex journey from a meticulously observant Orthodox Jewish background to her current faith. She takes readers from the static faith she experienced growing up through the geography of her spiritual search in many religious traditions to her marriage to a Christian minister and rejection of her birth family (with whom she later reconciled) and then to her rediscovery of her Jewish roots in a renewed form. Her story is a wonderful example of the transformation of what was, to the author, almost a dead faith into one that is vital and transformational yet accepting of Jews who define their faith more narrowly.

She is the author of the bestselling and award winning CATWINGS series. Three of Le Guin&#39;s titles have been finalists for The American Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, and among the many honors her writing has received are a National Book Award, five Hugo Awards, five Nebula Awards, and The Margaret A. Edwards Award. She lives in Oregon.The endearing winged cats who escaped the city to be cared for by two reliable country children (Catwings, 1988, etc.) make a third appearance in this tale of a self-important kitten from nearby who discovers that his true worth is not what he has supposed. Alexander--``the biggest, the strongest, and the loudest''--has never noticed that his sisters are ``quite tired of him,'' but when he sets out to explore the world he soon learns that his cocky preconceptions don't serve. The cow who says ``Moo'' instead of ``Mew'' is unconcerned when he corrects her; speeding trucks and rude dogs threaten; when he bolts up a tree, he can't climb down and his doting parents don't turn up to help. Enter youngest Catwing Jane, nearly mute because of an early trauma (her only words are ``Me'' and ``Hate''), to take Alexander to her home--where his parents and ``Owner'' turn out to be glad to let him stay. After Alexander cajoles and hectors Jane into confronting her fears and describing them with her first real words, the Catwings agree: Alexander is ``wonderful.'' Brief as it is, this is a deftly crafted bildungsroman. The book's small format and Schindler's delicate illustrations add to the enchantment. A first chapter book to charm both newly independent readers and their elders. (Fiction. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There is strange beauty in the cutaway views of five different hollow-wall fasteners and the machinations of nine types of pliers. But homeowners are, of course, the real target audience, and an all-new section on Landscaping reflects this with entries on fences, water gardens and retaining walls. The plumbing section offers a mega-view of wastewater-treatment systems as well as a micro-exploration of unclogging a toilet. Another new section, Storage Projects, is full of cabinets and shelves that either "Swing-out" or "Fold-away." New technologies are generally overlooked in favor of meat-and-potatoes projects. For instance, a home satellite dish is pictured but not indexed or dwelled upon, while carpeting is charted, graphed and deconstructed in the extreme.

These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten.

Catering to the wives, daughters, and sisters of Washington's political elite, she included among her clientele Mary Todd Lincoln, who became her close friend and confidante.<br>Keckley's behind-the-scenes view of wartime Washington not only provides fascinating glimpses of nineteenth-century America, but also offers candid observations on interracial relationships and the free black middle class. Here also are absorbing details of life in the Lincoln White House, as well as an insider's perspective on the men who made Civil War politics and the women who influenced them. A touching and revelatory work, filled with incisive social commentary, this inspiring narrative by an admirable woman will be an important addition to the libraries of anyone interested in African-American and Civil War history.</p><p>Only a few years later, however, that relationship was in ruins, when this 1868 book created a scandal. Intended by Keckley to rehabilitate the reputation of the former First Lady--who had run up extensive debts on clothing and other luxuries while in the White House, and found herself unable to repay them after the President's assassination--the book was perceived instead as a betrayal of friendship. <p> Perhaps one of the first examples of celebrity gossip publishing gone awry, Behind the Scenes does, nevertheless, offer an insider perspective on the Lincoln White House that will intrigue armchair historians and fans of biography alike.</p>Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley</p><h2>Genealogist&#39;s Guide to Discovering Your Scottish Ancestors</h2><p>Offers advice on genealogical research of Scottish ancestors covering such topics as Internet research, using Family History Centers, census records, church records, and land and probate records.</p><p>Linda Jonas has been a professional genealogist for 20 years and is president of the British Isles Family History Society-U.S.A.

Harry Haller is the Steppenwolf: wild, strange, shy and alienated from society. His despair and desire for death draw him into a dark, enchanted underworld. Through a series of shadowy encounters -romantic, freakish and savage by turn -the misanthropic Haller gradually begins to rediscover the lost dreams of his youth. This blistering portrayal of a man who feels himself to be half-human and half-wolf was the bible of the 1960s counterculture, capturing the mood of a disaffected generation, and remains a haunting story of estrangement and redemption.</p><p></p><h2>End Zone</h2><p>At Logos College in West Texas, huge young men, vacuum-packed into shoulder pads and shiny helmets, play football with intense passion. During an uncharacteristic winning season, the perplexed and distracted running back Gary Harkness has periodic fits of nuclear glee; he is fueled and shielded by his fear of and fascination with nuclear conflict. Among oddly afflicted and recognizable players, the terminologies of football and nuclear war--the language of end zones--become interchangeable, and their meaning deteriorates as the collegiate year runs its course. In this triumphantly funny, deeply searching novel, <b>Don DeLillo</b> explores the metaphor of football as war with rich, original zeal.</p><p>Don DeLillo's second novel, a sort of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> meets <i>North Dallas Forty</i>, solidified his place in the American literary landscape in the early 1970s. The story of an angst-ridden, war-obsessed running back for Logos College in West Texas, <i>End Zone</i> is a heady and hilarious conflation of Cold War existentialism and the parodied parallelism of battlefield/sports rhetoric. When not arguing nuclear endgame strategy with his professor, Major Staley, narrator Gary Harkness joins a brilliant and unlikely bunch of overmuscled gladiators on the field and in the dormitory. In characteristic fashion, DeLillo deliberately undermines the football-is-combat clichï¿½ by having one of his characters explain: "I reject the notion of football as warfare. Warfare is warfare. We don't need substitutes because we've got the real thing." What remains is an insightful examination of language in an alien, postmodern world, where a football player's ultimate triumph is his need to play the game.Don DeLillo is the author of two plays and thirteen novels, including Underworld and The Body Artist.

In this apostolic letter, Pope John Paul II reflects on the origins of suffering, explores the different types of suffering we endure, examines our quest to discover its meaning and purpose, and explains how we are to respond to suffering. He links our personal experiences with suffering to the mystery of humanity, of God, and to the redemption brought by Christ&#39;s suffering. This expanded anniversary edition offers the complete text of the letter, along with thought-provoking commentary by Myles N. Sheehan, SJ, MD. As a priest and a physician who was trained in geriatrics and specialized in palliative care, Dr. Sheehan approaches the topic of suffering from firsthand experience and extends his warm compassion to readers. This edition incorporates relevant biographical elements of John Paul II&#39;s life and of the respective historical period. It also makes the content of the papal document more accessible and places it in the context of recent world events, including September 11th, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and gun violence incidents in schools and public places across the nation. Each of the eight sections of the original document contains insightful questions suited for individual or group use, applicable prayers, and ideas for meaningful action, inviting readers to personally respond to the mystery of suffering. Whether you are revisiting or introducing yourself to this letter, it will help you work through the question that we all ask ourselves at some point in our lives: &#34;Why suffering?&#34; It is only natural to wonder why a person is the target for some sort of suffering-a chronic illness, the loss of a loved one, depression, a natural disaster, an act of violence, financial crisis...the list could go on.</p><p></p><h2>Martian Manhunter Vol. 2: The Red Rising</h2><p>MARS REBORN!<br><br> He was the last son of a dead world.

She lives in New York City.FEATHER ON THE BREATH OF GOD, A <br> PART ONE CHANG &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The first time I ever heard my father speak Chinese was at Coney Island. I don't remember how old I was then, but I must have been very young. This was in the early days, when we still went on family outings. We were walking along the boardwalk when we ran into the four Chinese men. My mother told the story often, as if she thought we'd forgotten. "You kids didn't know them and neither did I. They were friends of your father's, from Chinatown. You'd never heard Chinese before. You didn't know what was up. You stood there with your mouths hanging open--I had to laugh. 'Why are they singing? Why is Daddy singing?'" One of the men gave each of my sisters and me a dollar bill. I cashed mine into dimes and set out to win a goldfish. A dime bought you three chances to toss a Ping-Pong ball into one of many small fishbowls, each holding a quivering tangerine-colored fish. Overexcited, I threw recklessly, again and again. When all the dimes were gone I ran back to the grown-ups in tears. The man who had given me the dollar tried to give me another, but my parents wouldn't allow it.He pressed the bag of peanuts he had been eating into my hands and said I could have them all. I never saw any of those men again or heard anything about them. They were the only friends of my father's that I would ever meet. I would hear him speak Chinese again, but very seldom. In Chinese restaurants, occasionally on the telephone, once or twice in his sleep, and in the hospital when he was dying. So it was true, then. He really was Chinese. Up until that day I had not quite believed it. &nbsp; <br> My mother always said that he had sailed to America on a boat. He took a slow boat from China, was what she used to say, laughing. I wasn't sure whether she was serious, and if she was, why coming from China was such a funny thing. A slow boat from China. In time I learned that he was born not in China but in Panama. No wonder I only half-believed he was Chinese. He was only half-Chinese. &nbsp; <br> The facts I know about his life are unbearably few. Although we shared the same house for eighteen years, we had little else in common. We had no culture in common. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that we had no language in common. By the time I was born my father had lived almost thirty years in America, but to hear him speak you would not have believed this. About his failure to master English there always seemed to me something willful. Except for her accent--as thick as but so different from his--my mother had no such trouble. "He never would talk about himself much, you know.That was his way. He never really had much to say, in general. Silence was golden. It was a cultural thing, I think." (My mother.) By the time I was old enough to understand this, my father had pretty much stopped talking. Taciturnity: They say that is an Oriental trait. But I don't believe my father was always the silent, withdrawn man I knew. Think of that day at Coney Island, when he was talking a Chinese blue streak. Almost everything I know about him came from my mother, and there was much she herself never knew, much she had forgotten or was unsure of, and much she would never tell. &nbsp; <br> I am six, seven, eight years old, a schoolgirl with deplorable posture and constantly cracked lips, chafing in the dollish Old World clothes handmade by my mother; a bossy, fretful, sly, cowardly child given to fits of temper and weeping. In school, or in the playground, or perhaps watching television, I hear something about the Chinese--something odd, improbable. I will ask my father. He will know whether it is true, say, that the Chinese eat with sticks. He shrugs. He pretends not to understand. Or he scowls and says, "Chinese just like everybody else." ("He thought you were making fun of him. He always thought everyone was making fun of him. He had a chip on his shoulder. The way he acted, you'd've thought he was colored!") Actually, he said "evvybody." Is it true the Chinese write backwards? Chinese just like evvybody else. Is it true they eat dog? Chinese just like evvybody else. Are they really all Communists? Chinese just like evvybody else. What is Chinese water torture? What is foot-binding? What is a mandarin? Chinese just like evvybody else. He was not like everybody else. &nbsp; <br> The unbearably few facts are these. He was born in Colon, Panama, in 1911. His father came from Shanghai. From what I have been able to gather, Grandfather Chang was a merchant engaged in the trade of tobacco and tea. This business, which he ran with one of his brothers, kept him traveling often between Shanghai and Col <i></i>n. He had two wives, one in each city, and, as if out of a passion for symmetry, two sons by each wife. Soon after my father, Carlos, was born, his father took him to Shanghai, to be raised by the Chinese wife. Ten years later my father was sent back to Col <i></i>n. I never understood the reason for this. The way the story was told to me, I got the impression that my father was being sent away from some danger. This was, of course, a time of upheaval in China, the decade following the birth of the Republic, the era of the warlords. If the date is correct, my father would have left Shanghai the year the Chinese Communist party was founded there. It remains uncertain, though, whether political events had anything at all to do with his leaving China. One year after my father returned to Colon his motherwas dead. I remember hearing as a child that she had died of a stroke. Years later this would seem to me odd, when I figured out that she would have been only twenty-six. Odder still, to think of that reunion between the longparted mother and son; there's a good chance they did not speak the same language. The other half-Panamanian son, Alfonso, was either sent back with my father or had never left Col <i></i>n. After their mother's death the two boys came into the care of their father's brother and business partner, Uncle Mee, who apparently lived in Col <i></i>n and had a large family of his own. Grandfather Chang, his Chinese wife, and their two sons remained in Shanghai. All were said to have been killed by the Japanese. That must have been during the Sino-Japanese War. My father would have been between his late twenties and early thirties by then, but whether he ever saw any of those Shanghai relations again before they died, I don't know. At twelve or thirteen my father sailed to America with Uncle Mee. I believe it was just the two of them who came, leaving the rest of the family in Col <i></i>n. Sometime in the next year or so my father was enrolled in a public school in Brooklyn. I remember coming across a notebook that had belonged to him in those days and being jolted by the name written on the cover: Charles Cipriano Chang. That was neither my father's first nor his last name, as far as I knew, and I'd never heard of the middle name. (Hard to believe that my father spent his boyhood in Shanghai being called Carlos, a name he could not even pronounce with the proper Spanish accent. So he must have had a Chinese name as well. And although our family never knewthis name, perhaps among Chinese people he used it.) Twenty years passed. All I know about this part of my father's life is that it was lived illegally in New York, mostly in Chinatown, where he worked in various restaurants. Then came the Second World War and he was drafted. It was while he was in the army that he finally became an American citizen. He was no longer calling himself Charles but Carlos again, and now, upon becoming a citizen, he dropped his father's family name and took his mother's. Why a man who thought of himself as Chinese, who had always lived among Chinese, who spoke little Spanish, and who had barely known his mother would have made such a decision in the middle of his life is one of many mysteries surrounding my father. My mother had an explanation. "You see, Alfonso was a Panamanian citizen, and <i>he</i> had taken his mother's name" (which would, of course, be in keeping with Spanish cultural tradition). "He was the only member of his family your father had left--the others were all dead. Your father wanted to have the same last name as his brother. Also, he thought he'd get along better in this country with a Spanish name." This makes no sense to me. He'd been a Chinatown Chang for twenty years. Now all of a sudden he wished to pass for Hispanic? In another version of this story, the idea of getting rid of the Chinese name was attributed to the citizenship official handling my father's papers. This is plausible, given that immigration restrictions for Chinese were still in effect at that time. But I have not ruled out the possibility that the change of names was the result of a misunderstanding between my father and this official. My fatherwas an easily fuddled man, especially when dealing with authority, and he always had trouble understanding and making himself understood in English. And I can imagine him not only befuddled enough to make such a mistake but also too timid afterward to try to fix it. Whatever really happened I'm sure I'll never know. I do know that having a Spanish name brought much confusion into my father's life and have always wondered in what way my own life might have been different had he kept the name Chang. &nbsp; <br> From this point on the story becomes somewhat clearer. With the Hundredth Infantry Division my father goes to war, fights in France and Germany, and, after V-E Day, is stationed in the small southern German town where he will meet my mother. He is thirty-four and she has just turned eighteen. She is soon pregnant. Here is rich food for speculation: How did they communicate? She had had a little English in school. He learned a bit of German. They must have misunderstood far more than they understood of each other. Perhaps this helps to explain why my eldest sister was already two and my other sister on the way before my parents got married. (My sisters and I did not learn about this until we were in our twenties.) By the time I was three they would already have had two long separations. "I should have married Rudolf!" (My mother.) Nineteen forty-eight. My father returns to the States with his wife and first daughter. Now everything is drastically changed. A different America this: the America of thecitizen, the legal worker, the family man. No more drinking and gambling till all hours in Chinatown. No more drifting from job to job, living hand to mouth, sleeping on the floor of a friend's room or on a shelf in the restaurant kitchen. There are new, undreamed-of expenses: household money, layettes, taxes, insurance, a special bank account for the children's education. He does the best he can. He rents an apartment in the Fort Greene housing project, a short walk from the Cantonese restaurant on Fulton Street where he works as a waiter. Some nights after closing, after all the tables have been cleared and the dishes done, he stays for the gambling. He weaves home to a wide-awake wife who sniffs the whiskey on his breath and doesn't care whether he has lost or won. So little money--to gamble with any of it is a sin. Her English is getting better ("no thanks to him!"), but for what she has to say she needs little vocabulary. She is miserable. She hates America. She dreams incessantly about going home. There is something peculiar about the three-year-old: She rarely smiles; she claws at the pages of magazines, like a cat. The one-year-old is prone to colic. To her horror my mother learns that she is pregnant again. She attempts an abortion, which fails. I am born. About that attempt, was my father consulted? Most likely not. Had he been I think I know what he would have said. He would have said: No, this time it will be a boy. Like most men he would have wanted a son. (All girls--a house full of females--a Chinese man's nightmare!) Perhaps with a son he would have been more open. Perhaps a son he would have taught Chinese. He gets another job, as a dishwasher in the kitchen of a large public health service hospital. He will work thereuntil he retires, eventually being promoted to kitchen supervisor. He moves his family to another housing project, outside the city, newly built, cleaner, safer. He works all the time. On weekends, when he is off from the hospital, he waits on tables in one or another Chinese restaurant. He works most holidays and takes no vacation. On his rare day off he outrages my mother by going to the racetrack. But he is not self-indulgent. A little gambling, a quart of Budweiser with his supper--eaten alone, an hour or so after the rest of us (he always worked late)--now and then a glass of Scotch, cigarettes--these were his only pleasures. While the children are still small there are occasional outings. To Coney Island, Chinatown, the zoo. On Sundays sometimes he takes us to the children's matinee, and once a year to Radio City, for the Christmas or Easter show. But he and my mother never go out alone together, just the two of them--never. Her English keeps getting better, making his seem worse and worse. He is hardly home, yet my memory is of constant fighting. Not much vocabulary needed to wound. "Stupid woman. Crazy lady. Talk, talk, talk, talk--never say nothing!" "I should have married Rudolf!" Once, she spat in his face. Another time, she picked up a bread knife and he had to struggle to get it away from her. They slept in separate beds. Every few months she announced to the children that itwas over: We were going "home." (And she did go back with us to Germany once, when I was two. We stayed six months. About this episode she was always vague. In years to come, whenever we asked her why we did not stay in Germany, she would say, "You children wanted your father." But I think that is untrue. More likely she realized that there was no life for her back there. She had never gotten on well with her family. By this time I believe Rudolf had married another.) Even working the two jobs, my father did not make much money. He would never make enough to buy a house. Yet it seemed the burden of being poor weighed heavier on my mother. Being poor meant you could never relax, meant eternal attention to appearances. Just because you had no money didn't mean you were squalid. Come into the house: See how clean and tidy everything is. Look at the children: spotless. And people did comment to my mother--on the shininess of her floors and how she kept her children--and she was gratified by this. Still, being poor was exhausting. One day a woman waist-deep in children knocked at the door. When my mother answered, the woman apologized. "I thought--from the name on the mailbox I thought you were Spanish too. My kids needed to use the toilet." My mother could not hide her displeasure. She was proud of being German, and in those postwar years she was also bitterly defensive. When people called us names--spicks and chinks--she said, "You see how it is in this country. For all they say how bad we Germans are, no one ever calls you names for being German." She had no patience with my father's quirks. The involuntarytwitching of a muscle meant that someone had given him the evil eye. Drinking a glass of boiled water while it was still hot cured the flu. He saved back issues of <i>Reader's Digest</i> and silver dollars from certain years, believing that one day they'd be worth a lot of money. What sort of backward creature had she married? His English drove her mad. Whenever he didn't catch something that was said to him (...</p><h2>Man in White</h2><p><p>Music legend Johnny Cash's only novel is a portrait of six pivotal years in the life of St. Paul.

He heard nothing at first, then, again a <em>crunch</em>, <em>crunch</em>, like feet walking on straw. Then it stopped. He looked around the room in the dim light and saw that he was alone. <em>Maybe it was my imagination,</em> he thought and dozed off into a light sleep again. Then he heard the sound again and a light bumping noise. He looked slowly and silently around his room, first at the wall and the window, then, straining to see his door, he noted that it was still bolted. Nothing there. He looked at the back wall where the loom stood. He saw nothing unusual, yet there was the sound again. It was coming from the area of the room where the cubical stood that held his scrolls of Scripture. His eyes remained on the spot as the morning light slowly revealed the scene. The velvet covering had fallen to the floor. His scrolls were all in their place, except for one. It was pulled out a few centimeters and was being gnawed and eaten by a large rat. </p> <p>A low moan started in Saul's throat, and as the sound became audible, the rat stopped eating and raised its head, turning its black eyes upon Saul. Saul got up slowly. The rat didn't move. Saul reached down to the floor and picked up one of his sandals. He raised it over his head and with a grunt threw it at the rat. The rat leaped to the floor and disappeared. The sandal knocked another one of the scrolls to the floor. </p> <p>The rat was under the loom now, and Saul crept across the floor, pushed the loom over, and leaped with his bare feet down on the hard rock floor where the rat had been. He looked around the room, trying to decide where the rat had hidden. His cloak lay on the floor by the bed. He danced upon it, but the rat wasn't there. Embarrassed at himself, he turned again to survey the room. The vile rodent had to be near the basket and spindle. He slowly crept up and kicked the basket. The rat jumped out, but out with it came a mass of fibers its feet had become entangled in. The rat leaped left and right, sideways and upside down in a frenzy to free itself, but it only succeeded in entangling itself more. Saul watched it squirm as it bound itself in a web of cotton. He slipped on a sandal and pressed the rat down on the floor with his foot. The monster shrieked and clawed, trying to free itself. He looked down at his head with hatred, deciding just how to kill it. </p> <p>Just as he was about to take its life, he remembered. "The filthy thing has shreds of the sacred Scriptures in its stomach," Saul said aloud to himself. He paused.<em> It must die,</em> he thought, but still he couldn't crush it, thinking of the precious scroll. "What a horrible visitation upon me," he whispered, standing on one foot and holding the rat down with the other. "What, O Lord, is the meaning of this?" he moaned. "I spend all my waking hours on your holy Word, and a messenger of Satan, a . . . a veritable demon of hell steals in while I sleep." </p> <p>He stood thinking for a long time, then finally reached down and put his thumb and fingers firmly behind the rat's head. He picked it up and broke it and its wrapping free from the rest of the mass. He opened the door and flung the live rat, tied just as it was, far out into the street. He didn't watch to see if the rat escaped from its bondage; he just closed the door and bolted it. </p> <p>The room was a shambles. First Saul picked up the scroll that had fallen to the floor and examined it in the light under the window. It was the book of the prophet Isaiah. Unrolling its two rollers, he discovered that there was a bend and a small rip in the parchment where his sandal had hit it. <em>I could have it repaired by a Torah scribe,</em> he thought. He had copied the scrolls himself years ago, writing with a stylus on parchment. The ink he had made by mixing cypress with lamp black. If he had only remembered to use oil of wormwood in the ink mixture, the bitterness would have discouraged rodents and insects from eating the scrolls. </p> <p>He examined the other damaged scroll carefully and saw that the rodent had indeed eaten a part of it. He opened up the scroll of Chronicles and laid it across the table. Even though some of the text was missing, Saul knew the passage well. The words were a thousand years old--God's promise to Solomon--"If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and will heal their land." </p> <p>God made these promises to Israel during the Feast of Tabernacles at the dedication of the Temple Solomon had built, the first great Temple that had stood where the greater Temple now stood. Accompanying these promises was a warning: "If you observe my statutes and my judgments, I will establish the throne of your kingdom . . . But if you turn away . . . and serve other gods . . ." </p> <p>The rat had done more damage than he thought as he unrolled the scroll further, gently pushing the parchment across the table. "This house which I have sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight. And it will be a proverb and a byword among all nations . . . Because they have forsaken the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt . . ." </p> <p>He moaned at the desecration of the Holy Scriptures, the horrid toothmarks on the scroll. </p> <p>"The holy Temple of the Most High shall never fall," he said. "His service and his house are my life, my daily portion, my daily service." </p> <p>He rolled the scroll back up and placed it carefully and lovingly back in the cubicle. It took awhile to put the loom, basket, and spindle back in order. Having done this, he went to the basin and washed himself all over, brushed his hair and his beard, and put on a clean loincloth and tunic. He faced in the direction of the Temple, where the sun rising over Mt. Nebo was beginning to bathe its pinnacles in a golden glow. Then he began his morning prayers. It was to be a long, troubled day. </p> <p> </p> <p>Jonathan ben Annas, the high priest, looked down at the young Pharisee who stood before him. He was a small man; his hair and short curly beard were auburn, but his dark eyes under heavy black eyebrows were alive and piercing. Saul of Tarsus had brought before the Sanhedrin another prisoner charged with blasphemy. Only forty-two members of the Sanhedrin were present. Many had excused themselves, claiming other business rather than hearing the case against and deciding the fate of yet another follower of the crucified Nazarene. </p> <p>Since the last days of Herod, the Temple at Jerusalem was watched over by what the Jews called "the evil eye in the sky"--the perpetual presence of Roman guards who stood watch atop the fortress Antonia at the northwest corner of the Temple complex. This fortress could barrack as many as a thousand soldiers. Adjacent to one side of the fortress were stables for the soldiers' Syrian horses. The Roman governor, Marcellus, was afforded every luxury that his office and position allowed. His hall of justice was on the main floor under the tower with business offices and chambers around it. Underneath the justice hall was the prison, a dark, musky, vile-smelling nightmare almost as large as the barracks itself. Into this dungeon were thrown the rabble of Jerusalem, the drunks, thieves, and rebels, anyone who wouldn't bow to Roman law, and captured Zealots, those awaiting trial for active organized resistance to Roman rule in Judea. </p> <p>On a balcony on the side of the great hall that touched the Temple wall were two huge iron doors at which ten Roman soldiers always stood guard. Beyond these doors was a hallway through the wall, a no-man's-land forty cubits long that led to another pair of huge iron doors that opened into the Temple area. The hall through the Temple wall was cut by Herod, and the pious spat in disgust at the sound of his name. They could never forget that the holy Temple of God was defiled on the northwest corner by the presence of the hated Romans. Their tower could even be seen from a portion of the open sacrificial court. Inside the second pair of iron doors was a large balcony from which seventy wide steps descended into the Court of the People and onto the Temple complex. </p> <p>On feast days and other holidays, this giant Temple rectangle accommodated enormous throngs of pilgrims. Its outside walls were eight hundred cubits long. Made of precision-cut white stone blocks, the walls were eighty cubits high and forty cubits thick. The Temple in Jerusalem was the center of worship and sacrifice, yet very few people were ever in the area of the steps that led up to the guarded doors. A Jew would consider himself unclean if he set foot on the pavement of the fortress Antonia. </p> <p>The Temple building nearest to these steps was the hall Gazith, the Palace of Hewn Stone, or the council chamber of the Sanhedrin. The Jews wanted to believe that the Sanhedrin was the highest court of all, but there was no denying that Roman officials had supreme power, even over routing Jewish affairs if they chose to become involved. The installation of a high priest as head of this council was automatically approved by the Roman governor if the man elected was willing to adhere to Roman military and civil policy. </p> <p>The Sanhedrin sat in session daily except on the Sabbath and holy days, governing the religious order of Jews; its decisions and pronouncements were adhered to not only by the Jews of Judea but by those dispersed throughout the empire as well. In this chamber the seventy-two members voted to, or not to, allocate funds from the Temple treasury for various projects and charities. Malefactors were judged before this body of men; suits were decided and judgment pronounced. </p> <p>Behind Saul stood a man called Stephen. He was barefoot, and apparently the only garment he had on was the rough goat-hair robe he wore. He stood perfectly still, and though his beardless chin was caked with dried blood and a large blue bruise was evident on his cheek, ...</p></p><h2>Shadow and Silk</h2><p><b>A Split Second Is All It Takes...<br><br></b>Professor Dani Warren was willing to risk her reputation searching for that priceless piece of sacred Tibetan silk.

Completely resigned to their fate. A fly landed on the forehead of the nearest one&#x2014;the one he was to kill&#x2014;and the captive let it crawl about, tasting his sweat.</p><p>Jacob listened to the spokesman continue to rail in Arabic, a small crowd gathered in the square, outnumbered two to one by the gunmen. He didn&#x2019;t understand the language but could guess at what was being said.</p><p><i>These men are traitors. This is the fate that befalls all who oppose the </i>Kalipha<i>. Stand with us, or suffer the same.</i></p><p>Far from cheering, the small grouping of people looked cowed, as if they wanted to be anywhere but there. Well, that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. They&#x2019;d rather be on the outside watching than on their bellies with their necks stretched out.</p><p>The spokesman droned on, building toward a grand spectacle, his black tunic covered in dust, the AK-47 swinging about with his body language, and Jacob knew it was coming close. Execution time. His first.</p><p>In the seven months he&#x2019;d been inside the cult of death known as the Islamic State, he&#x2019;d witnessed many, many executions, acting as a gunman on the periphery, but he&#x2019;d never done one on his own.</p><p>Not that he minded killing. It hadn&#x2019;t bothered him in the past, but the action had always been at the barrel of a gun, and he wondered how this would feel. In a detached, almost scientific way, he wondered if it would be different from carving the carcasses of the rabbits he&#x2019;d killed in his youth. When he&#x2019;d literally had to hunt for survival.</p><p>He looked at his partners, seeing Hussein fidgeting, the nervous tics growing more pronounced. He wasn&#x2019;t built for this cauldron, and Jacob thought it ironic that Hussein was the one who had recruited them. Convinced them to come to this faraway land.</p><p>Not that they had many alternatives after fleeing the cesspool of &#x201c;rehabilitation&#x201d; they&#x2019;d been placed within. Killing the guard had ensured that.</p><p>Carlos and Devon, now known as Yousef and Talib, showed no such hesitation. They had embraced the cult of death completely, changing their names and fervently soaking up the Salafist ideology like a cactus in the rain. They were on board one hundred and ten percent, considering this day a sacred one.</p><p>Jacob played the role, but he&#x2019;d long since lost belief in religion. Any religion. He&#x2019;d had that whipped out of him by the pious Christian guards in the white house.</p><p>No, it wasn&#x2019;t the religion. It was the power. In this land, from Mosul to Raqqa, all that mattered was the courage of the battle-axe, and he&#x2019;d found a skill that he didn&#x2019;t realize he possessed. He knew he would die here, but it caused no angst. In truth, he had died long ago. All that remained was for him to slip the coils of his mortal frame. The difference was a cause. He wouldn&#x2019;t end up as a page-two news story, caught stealing hubcaps and gunned down in the street. And neither would the men he had brought.</p><p>Hussein may have recruited him, and the other two may have changed their names, diving headlong into the myth of the Islamic State, but he was the leader of their small group. Just as he had been inside.</p><p>With that mantle came a responsibility.</p><p>A man in black, completely covered from head to toe, like something out of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie, began walking his way. Jacob inwardly grimaced.</p><p>His name was Abu Yabba Dabba Do, or some other unpronounceable Arabic crap, but Jacob called him Ringo. As in the Beatles. An Islamic fighter from England, he and others like him considered themselves above Jacob and his band because they were of Arabic descent. Ringo was Yemeni. Jacob was a mutt.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Jacob, are you ready for your first kill?&#x201d;</p><p>He drew out the name <i>Jacob</i>, showing his disdain for the Biblical reference and the fact that Jacob refused to take an Arabic one.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t my first, you shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo smirked and said, &#x201c;Death with a gun is not killing. You&#x2019;ll see. This is absolute control. Absolute. As Mohammad dictated. But your little band of Lost Boys wouldn&#x2019;t know about that.&#x201d;</p><p>He was being tested, which was what he expected. Ringo had beheaded many men, and had developed a cult following on Twitter and other social media, but he was an ass. A small man who gained importance after the fact. After the fighting was done, using his knife and a camera to become famous. At his core, Jacob knew Ringo felt a challenge from him and his friends.</p><p>Four tightly knit brothers, forged by a fire outside the Islamic State, with&#x2014;except for Hussein&#x2014;no attachment to any Arabic or Islamic heritage, they were an anomaly. True foreign fighters in a foreign land. They called themselves the Lost Boys because of the iconic &#x2019;80s movie, but the analogy was apt. They lived in a world of the shadows.</p><p>And they killed better than most.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;Ringo, step away.&#x201d;</p><p>That was all.</p><p>And Ringo did.</p><p>Ringo had seen the punishment the Lost Boys had endured. With two blond Caucasians, one African American, and Hussein, the one who had recruited them, their arrival had been anything but welcoming. Convinced they were spies or, at best, journalists, the emir had subjected them to inhuman conditions and cruelty. And they had thrived.</p><p>Because of the white house.</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;You are not the future. <i>We</i> are the future. <i>Kafir</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob looked up, catching Ringo&#x2019;s pompous eyes with the dead ones he possessed, and said, &#x201c;The future is dictated by the man who isn&#x2019;t afraid to die. Is that you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;I am not afraid. I have proved that multiple times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you wish to die today? Without fear?&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob knew his reputation from Mosul preceded him. Knew that Ringo hated the fact that he was a blond-headed, blue-eyed American, with no ancestral ties to the coming caliphate, but he also knew that Ringo couldn&#x2019;t get past the stories that had grown into legends.</p><p>Ringo snarled and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see, Lost Boy. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>And walked away.</p><p>The man on the square finished his speech, which was like every other one, and not unlike speeches given by the blowhard preachers Jacob had heard every night in the reform school. There was a flourish at the end, then a knife placed in his hand.</p><p>He looked at the four men prostrate in front of him, and felt the hatred.</p><p>They were snitches. People who&#x2019;d sold out the clan for money, giving information to the enemy for targeted air strikes and intelligence on how the Islamic State functioned. Jacob would have had qualms about killing someone for eating pork or not wearing a head wrap, but he had none for traitors.</p><p>They were the ones who had caused the pain in his past. Had caused the trips to the white house.</p><p>He looked at his man, a Kurd. Strange that such a person had been able to penetrate so deeply, given the fight against the Peshmerga, but he had. And he&#x2019;d given massive information about the Islamic State to the Americans. Now he would die.</p><p>But the fly on his forehead would live.</p><p>He swished the man&#x2019;s face and saw it buzz away. Then leaned down, wrapping his hand into the hair, pulling it up.</p><p>As he had as a child, when the next &#x201c;new&#x201d; father had come into the room, stinking of whiskey and taking off his belt, he let his humanity float away, flying on a cloud. Gone.</p><p>He became a man of stone.</p><p>He looked down the line, seeing the ubiquitous cameraman recording the killing, then Carlos and Devon eagerly snatching up their own heads and looking to him for guidance. He waited on Hussein.</p><p>He caught the tears on Hussein&#x2019;s cheeks and wondered if the man would go through with it. He saw Ringo advancing and shouted, &#x201c;Hussein!&#x201d;</p><p>His friend looked at him and Jacob said, &#x201c;For the white house. Do it for the white house.&#x201d;</p><p>Hussein rapidly nodded, then pulled up the head.</p><p>Jacob turned to his own man, seeing his eyes rolling back, feeling the shaking in his body, the bright orange smock soaked in sweat.</p><p>The first swipe brought a gout of blood. He reached bone, and began sawing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Omar al-Khatami watched the tape without a shred of revulsion, technically looking for the propaganda value. His media specialist described how he had enhanced the image, optimizing it for YouTube, and said, &#x201c;This will show the Americans what happens to their spies, and prevent others from following in their steps.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;Yes. Post it tonight. End with the heads on the bodies.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened and the emir of northern Syria entered.</p><p>Mildly surprised, Omar exchanged greetings and said, &#x201c;Adnan, I thought you weren&#x2019;t returning for two days. What is happening with the oil?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming along. We only have the wells pumping at a quarter of capacity because of a lack of technical skill, but we have found men to change that. Soon, we will double our output and our revenues. As long as you don&#x2019;t lose the fields.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;No chance of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, because I have some news. The caliph has bestowed a great honor on you. He has promoted you to the emir of external operations.&#x201d;</p><p>The mention of the leader of the Islamic State brought a pause. Confused, Omar said, &#x201c;External operations? I am the military commander here. I still have work to do. Aleppo to take. Damascus to burn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The caliph has heard of your Lost Boys, and he thinks it is time to use them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then do so, but don&#x2019;t pull me from my men. They fight because of me. The time is growing short for victory. This will be a setback we can&#x2019;t afford, given the American attacks.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan scowled and said, &#x201c;The caliph believes in you. And your American cell. He chose you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why? We have many men who could do this. You, for instance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of your skill, for one. And because you are Chechen. You have traveled in Europe. You know the contacts. You can build the attack he desires.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These Lost Boys are untested. I&#x2019;m unsure of their commitment.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at the computer screen, the video paused with four men slicing and cutting. &#x201c;Is this not them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They show commitment here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could be simple fear. Hussein, the Jordanian, cried throughout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the others?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar grudgingly admitted they showed no qualms, but said, &#x201c;The leader of these so-called Lost Boys hasn&#x2019;t even taken a proper name. He still goes by Jacob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you tested him, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. Adnan said, &#x201c;The name is why we want them. They will all revert back to their true names. They are gems buried in the sand. Four Americans with no ties to America. No families, no Facebook, no Twitter. They are unknown. Unlike the others who brag to their friends back home, nobody knows they exist. No authorities are fervently tracking their moves. True?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. We instructed them on methods of recruitment, but they have shown no interest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Keep it that way. Their mission will be the greatest recruitment drive we have ever seen.&#x201d;</p><p>The media specialist fidgeted, getting Adnan&#x2019;s attention. He said, &#x201c;Emir, they are on this video. The one we&#x2019;re going to post for the world to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. Broadcast the stills of the verdict, but keep the executioners out.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;We lose the impact with our own people. They need to see. They need to fear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then let our men see it, but obscure the faces, and do not put it on social media. The Americans must be protected, and those <i>kafirs</i> in the United States have ways of determining the tiniest things.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. &#x201c;It will be done. What about me?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at him with a question, and he said, &#x201c;When do you wish me to start, and what will the target be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Targets. Plural. Every attack attempted by that windbag Zawahiri and his diseased al Qaida has resulted in failure because the <i>kafirs</i> managed to hear about it before execution. We have to assume the same will happen here, so we will plan two attacks. One for them to chase, and one for you to execute.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar went through the ramifications in his mind. Having fought in Grozny against a barbaric Russian army, he recognized the wisdom. He said, &#x201c;Just preparation for the false flag attack?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. A real attack. One that you will plan from start to finish. You pick the target and the method. The only parameter is that it must be outside of the caliphate. Outside the borders here. If it succeeds, so much the better, but its primary mission is to protect your American cell. Obviously, don&#x2019;t tell the other team about that. Let them think they are the chosen ones.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar absorbed the words, glancing away and nodding, thinking through the possibilities. He said, &#x201c;And the real target?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;The real one will destroy the heart of the <i>kafirs</i>.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>Waiting on the president to finish, eyes glued to a television, Colonel Hale sat with the rest of the Oversight Council, watching him getting raked over the coals in the White House James S.

He had come to the Crown at fourteen, of age in law; but for a warrior-king, the true rite of passage into adulthood came only with the accolade of knighthood.</p><p>He would receive that accolade on his eighteenth birthday, conferred by both his royal uncles. Richard Haldane Duke of Carthmoor, younger half-brother of the late King Donal, was reckoned one of the most accomplished knights of his generation, and had ultimate responsibility for the training of all the young boys and adolescents who came to court to hone their warrior skills in royal service. In his hands, Brion Haldane had been but another squire as he completed his apprenticeship, wearing no crown when he bowed himself to the discipline his uncle imposed; and he had learned his lessons well.</p><p>Slated to assist Duke Richard was King Brion&#x2019;s other uncle: his mother&#x2019;s brother, Illann King of Howicce and Llannedd, come with his son and heir, Prince Ronan (himself only recently knighted), to likewise lay his royal hand on the sword that conferred this public recognition of his nephew&#x2019;s true coming of age.</p><p>Many were the noble witnesses to this royal rite of passage. In addition to his family&#x2014;his mother, his surviving brother, and two younger sisters&#x2014;some were young men like the king himself: Ewan Duke of Claibourne, but three-and-thirty; Sir Phares Donovan and Sir Jaska Collins, among the last knights to be made by Brion&#x2019;s late father; Sir Joris Talbot, eldest son of Meara&#x2019;s royal governor; and Sir Jamyl Arilan, a favored companion of the king, knighted by Duke Richard but two years before, whose late uncle Seisyll had served both Brion and his father before him.</p><p>Others had been his father&#x2019;s friends and confidantes: Tiarnï¿½n MacRae and Jiri Redfearn, both with sons now preparing for royal service, and several of the great earls: Jared McLain Earl of Kierney, Caulay MacArdry Earl of Transha, and Sir Kenneth Morgan, now Earl of Lendour, who had come to his title through his young son, Alaric Morgan, who was sired on a Deryni heiress and destined to become the king&#x2019;s magical protector and companion&#x2014;if he could be kept alive that long. For though young Alaric was heir to a great duchy, one of only four in the land, he also was not yet eight years old, with powerful enemies who would risk much to see him dead.</p><p>Meanwhile, Brion King of Gwynedd had enemies of his own, both east and west. Happily for his young reign, none of these had yet dared any overt measures to undermine his crown&#x2014;none, at least, that had required direct intervention. Separatist factions in Meara, to the west, continued to skirt the edges of rebellion, but nothing had flared that was beyond the ability of the provincial royal governor to quell it. That would change, as it always did in Meara&#x2014;King Donal had been obliged to mount expeditions into Meara on a regular basis&#x2014;but for now, all was quiet in the province.</p><p>So it was, as well, in Torenth, to the east&#x2014;at least so far as anyone knew. Not long before Brion&#x2019;s accession, the Kingdom of Torenth had suffered serious upheavals in the highest echelons of power: the still-unexplained death of King Nimur&#x2019;s eldest son, Crown Prince Nimur, and the subsequent setting aside of the second son, Prince Torval, in favor of Prince Kï¿½roly, the meek and bookish third son. Torenth had offered no official statement beyond the bare announcement of Prince Nimur&#x2019;s passing, but the House of Furstï¿½n was Deryni, and used its magic openly&#x2014;which could explain much. Persistent rumor had it that the true cause of Prince Nimur&#x2019;s death had been a magical experiment gone horribly wrong, and that his brother Torval had been present, and was driven mad by what he had seen and experienced.</p><p>Whatever the cause, this unforeseen shift in the Torenthi succession had left Torenth ill equipped to take advantage of the youth and inexperience of Gwynedd&#x2019;s new king. Both Prince Nimur and his brother had been grown men, well capable of backing up an aging sire in declining health; and neither would have hesitated to take up the Torenthi cause, which was the eventual re-conquest of Gwynedd.</p><p>That assumption appeared not to hold true for Prince Kï¿½roly, the new Torenthi heir, who was a decade older than Brion, but had received only a rudimentary portion of the education for kingship that was lavished on his two elder brothers&#x2014;and his own heir was young yet, and certainly lacking in the training of a future king. Of a certainty, Kï¿½roly would have set about remedying that deficiency while Brion scrambled to complete his own training for kingship, but thus far, Torenth had made no move beyond the usual border incursions that tested periodically at Gwynedd&#x2019;s eastern defenses.</p><p>Old King Nimur had even sent an envoy bearing his congratulations on King Brion&#x2019;s knighting&#x2014;Count Jï¿½nos Sokrat, aged but little since his visit for Brion&#x2019;s fourteenth birthday observances&#x2014;but no Torenthi royalty accompanied him this time around. The king&#x2019;s advisors duly noted the Torenthi presence, and the absence of any over-large escort, and concluded that the visit was unlikely to spawn any great threat. Brion, so advised, put the matter out of his head and set about readying himself for the ceremony.<br><br> <b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>&#x201c;Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;ECCLESIASTES 10:17</p><p>STANDING in his own great hall at Rhemuth, surrounded by men sworn to uphold him, Brion King of Gwynedd knew that the faintly queasy sensation in his gut came of no rational fear for his safety. Nonetheless, the sight of a foreign king standing between him and his throne, armed and crowned, could not but give one pause, especially when that king was accompanied by another prince regarded as one of the most puissant warriors in all the Eleven Kingdoms.</p><p>That the two men were his royal uncles only partially reassured, for blood greed had been the downfall of many a young king come prematurely to his crown, with still much to learn of his craft as monarch and warrior&#x2014;and Brion had been but fourteen at his coronation, hardly four years before.</p><p>Nonetheless, all experience before and since that day declared that Brion King of Gwynedd need harbor no such misgivings about these two men. For as long as he could remember, Prince Richard Haldane, younger half-brother of his late father, had been his teacher, his mentor, his most merciless critic when Brion failed to do his very best.</p><p>As for the goodwill of his other uncle&#x2014;the one who wore a crown of his own&#x2014;that, likewise, was beyond question. Illann King of Howicce and Llannedd was the beloved elder brother of Brion&#x2019;s mother, the Dowager Queen Richeldis, come especially to honor this milestone in his nephew&#x2019;s young reign. He stood now at Richard&#x2019;s left, peacock-bright in the colors of Howicce and Llannedd amid all that Haldane crimson. Both he and Richard were the sons of kings, of blood equally royal to Brion&#x2019;s own, yet they had come to their feet at their nephew&#x2019;s approach, inclining their heads in respect.</p><p>The man who had presented the royal candidate, and had fixed the golden spurs to his heels, was also of blood both ancient and royal. Ewan Duke of Claibourne was a direct descendant of the last prince of Kheldour, to the north, and one of only four dukes in Gwynedd. Assisting him had been the scion of another great ducal family: Jared Earl of Kierney, deputizing for his ailing father, the Duke of Cassan. Like the royal uncles, both of these men also wore noble coronets upon their brows, and all of them bore steel at their hips.</p><p>By contrast, Brion King of Gwynedd wore no crown or other emblem of his royal estate, no rich raiment or even any weapon. With his sable hair caught back severely in a warrior&#x2019;s knot, he had donned the robes traditional to any candidate for knighthood: the unadorned inner robe of white, signifying the purity of his honor, partially covered by the stark black over-tunic symbolic of the grave to which all eventually must come.</p><p>Over both lay the bloodred mantle: fittingly, in Brion&#x2019;s case, of Haldane crimson. To such blood had he been born&#x2014;blood which, even more than any mere knight, he must be willing to shed in defense of his realm, even unto death. At his coronation, the new king had pledged his life to his kingdom: reckoned a man, in law, for the governing of his realm, and well enough prepared in mind, but all too aware that he wore still the body of a half-grown youth, with much yet to learn of the warrior he must become, if he hoped to keep his crown.</p><p>That he had kept it thus far was due, in part, to his royal uncles, to the princely dukes flanking him, and to the loyalty and courage of the sandy-haired man standing close beside the throne: Sir Kenneth Morgan Earl of Lendour, who bore the great state crown of leaves and crosses intertwined as if it were no more burden than its mere weight of gold and precious stones, though he had saved it and Brion&#x2019;s life on more than one occasion.</p><p>And the towheaded boy at Kenneth&#x2019;s side, who had proudly carried the golden spurs now affixed to the king&#x2019;s heels, and assisted in their fastening, was cut from the same cloth as his sire: quick and earnest, utterly devoted to Brion, and so much more than he appeared to be, for all that he was only seven years of age. Because his mother had been heiress to a great duchy, Alaric Morgan would be Duke of Corwyn when he came of age, one of the most powerful men in the land. But Alyce de Corwyn had also been Deryni, possessor of powers both feared and resented by ordinary folk&#x2014;which meant that many feared who and what young Alaric was, and what he might become.</p><p>The Church, in particular, had made its position abundantly clear regarding Deryni, for those trained in that heritage were believed to wield extraordinary powers that could compromise another&#x2019;s free will and even enslave the soul of the unwitting. Several of Gwynedd&#x2019;s bishops, some of whom were present today, had been particularly vocal in their condemnation, and one of them had nearly been the death of Alaric&#x2019;s mother before he was even born.</p><p>Yet King Brion&#x2019;s father, only days before his death, had commended the boy Alaric to Brion&#x2019;s especial attention and care, promising a legacy of benign magical powers to be employed in Brion&#x2019;s service, and further powers to be imparted for Brion&#x2019;s own use.</p><p>Was it true? Brion was not sure he remembered all that had been told him, but he believed and hoped that further knowledge would be revealed to him in due course&#x2014;hopefully, well before he really needed it! And it was all somehow linked to the blond boy holding a crimson pillow beside the throne of Gwynedd.</p><p>But that was for the future&#x2014;with any luck, some years in the future, when Alaric Morgan was grown. For now, Brion returned his full focus to his uncles, from whom he was about to receive the knightly accolade, which only another knight might bestow.</p><p>&#x201c;Your Royal Highness,&#x201d; a herald intoned, addressing Richard, &#x201c;having been invested with the spurs, the noble squire Brion Haldane now presents himself before the throne of Gwynedd to request the accolade from your hand, that he may henceforth be recognized as a knight.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard inclined his head, a faint smile curving within the sable mustache and close-clipped beard as his eyes met Brion&#x2019;s, Haldane grey to Haldane grey. In that moment, wearing Haldane crimson and a royal diadem, with one hand resting on the hilt of the sword at his hip, he very much resembled his late brother.</p><p>&#x201c;Kneel now, Brion Haldane,&#x201d; he commanded.</p><p>With a nod of his head that was more jerky than intended, Brion moved forward to kneel on the scarlet cushion that young Alaric Morgan now set atop the first step of the dais; before, it had borne the golden spurs. As he settled himself and looked up, Richard turned to the crimson-clad duty-squire standing behind him: Brion&#x2019;s younger brother and heir presumptive, the twelve-year-old Prince Nigel, who extended the hilt of the sheathed Haldane sword, borne by many generations of Haldane kings. He retained the jeweled scabbard as his uncle drew forth the blade in a hiss of fine steel, clasping it to his breast in wide-eyed awe as Richard raised the blade and briefly brought the sword&#x2019;s cross-hilt to his lips in salute.</p><p>Richard paused then as King Illann reached across to rest his bejeweled hand atop Richard&#x2019;s, in pointed reminder that <i>this</i> knighthood came by way of <i>two</i> lines of royal kings and noble knights. The significance was not lost on Brion or, indeed, on any of those present.</p><p>Very briefly, as the flat of the blade descended toward his right shoulder, Brion closed his eyes and prayed that he might be worthy of this new charge, then lifted his gaze to Richard&#x2019;s once more, as the flat of the blade touched his right shoulder and Richard spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;In the name of the Father, and of the Son&#x201d;&#x2014;the blade lifted to touch the left shoulder&#x2014;&#x201c;and of the Holy Spirit&#x201d;&#x2014;the blade arched upward to briefly rest atop Brion&#x2019;s head&#x2014;&#x201c;be thou a good and faithful knight. Amen.&#x201d;</p><p>As the blade lifted again, to briefly rest over Richard&#x2019;s right shoulder, he glanced aside at Illann with a speaking glance. Smiling, Illann offered the new knight his right hand and said, &#x201c;Arise, Sir Brion Haldane, and be invested with the further symbols of your new estate.&#x201d;</p><p>Murmurs of approval rippled among the assembled witnesses as Brion clasped his uncle&#x2019;s hand and got to his feet, grinning as he accepted the bear hug that the older man offered. Richard, after passing the Haldane blade to Prince Nigel, likewise offered the new knight a quick embrace. As he did so, a beaming Dowager Queen Richeldis joined them from the sidelines, flanked by Brion&#x2019;s two younger sisters. Xenia, the adoring thirteen-year-old, proudly bore the white belt across both hands like some holy relic: the most visible outward symbol of the honor her brother had just received. Silke, who was nine, had been entrusted with a single red rose.</p><p>Composing himself to a properly kingly mien, Brion bent to kiss his mother&#x2019;s hand, then straightened and lifted his arms to either side so that she and his sisters could pass the belt around his waist and under his mantle, stark white against the sable of his over-robe.</p><p>&#x201c;Congratulations, my son,&#x201d; his mother murmured, as she fastened its jeweled clasp. &#x201c;May this belt be always a reminder to keep your honor spotless.&#x201d;</p><p>When she had kissed him on both cheeks and hugged him close, Silke shyly presented him with her rose, which he tucked into his belt. He then accepted a kiss from each of his sisters, in turn.</p></p><h2>Shep - Forever Faithful</h2><p>Between the gray twilight of the Great Depression and the perilous dawn of World War II, from 1936 to 1942, a heartwarming story of extraordinary loyalty quietly unfolded along the Great Northern Railroad in the remote little prairie town of historic Fort Benton, the birthplace of Montana. A story of faithfulness so unbelievable it warmed the world&#39;s heart as it was recorded in the pages of Ripley&#39;s Believe It Or Not. This is the story of Shep, the once vagrant mongrel who became America&#39;s most legendary dog. Strong principles and simple virtues, taught by a long-departed master, were exemplified by the life of his loyal dog while keeping a five-year lonely vigil for the master&#39;s return. Shep&#39;s amazing story now belongs to the ages, a classic piece of American history told and retold throughout the years by the Associated Press, UPI, Reader&#39;s Digest, Paul Harvey, and other major publications. A story of a noble dog, a soul; forever faithful; and an undying love for his master that endured the hardships of mortal existence and never wavered. A story told through the eyes of a young family struggling against personal misfortune, and the adversity of hard times in an unfamiliar town, a town of a last frontier.</p><p>Stewart Beveridge.

Beveridge and Lee Nelson ISBN: 0-615-12854-8 332 pages Shep Forever Faithful is a story of devotion that stretches beyond the noblest of imaginations. Stewart H. Beveridge and Lee Nelson have written a wonderful story of a devoted dog and his ability to transform the lives of everyone he met, as well as everyone who eventually learned of his tale. This story resonates in the hearts of those who have ever had a bond with a dog, and the kind of love that can only be shared between man and his faithful companion. Shep has been described by others as a truly faithful dog. As Beveridge and Nelson point out, the true story of Shep has graced the pages of national newspaper headlines and found its way into the annals of Ripley&#39;s Believe it or Not. However, the story of Shep is much more than an anecdote; it is one of true friendship and loyalty that is unconditional and rarely ever exhibited. Shep nuzzles his way into the reader&#39;s heart from the opening chapters, as his heroism is detailed by struggling to fend off a pack of hungry wolves in the middle of a terrible thunderstorm. Shep&#39;s extraordinary abilities are showcased later when he attempts to corral stray sheep that had been scattered throughout town. As impressive as these feats are, they are easily overshadowed by Shep&#39;s overwhelming devotion to his master. After Shep&#39;s master dies from illness, Shep follows his body from their camp to the train station where the casket is send home. Shep would wait for his master at that train station for the rest of his life. This story is as much about devotion as it is about redemption. Whether we follow a husband who can&#39;t seem to take care of his family, an insecure bar owner who preys on the fragile, or a single mother who regrets the decision she has made, each deals with their individual failures and struggles to make things right. Shep is certainly the fulcrum in their lives, and he provides the hope that can get lost in difficult times. Beveridge and Nelson have penned a story worthy of the highest praise in Shep Forever Faithful. Their understanding of the dynamic between man and animal has created a story with the love, hope, pain and heartache essential to convey Shep&#39;s impact on the many lives he touched. Each relationship in the story is authentically genuine and woven together with respect for the real individuals.

Many typical features of the Greek spirit are imprinted on the myth - a tendency towards competition, the affirmation of life, the worship of beauty, and the interest of the Greeks in man as man, leading to the creation of an idealised picture of him, which served to promote rules of life of general authority.A great many people from one end of the earth to the other have a mythology of gods and heroes. It is, however, only ancient Greek mythology which, thanks to its quality, has transcended every geographical and chronological frontier and has become a possession of the human spirit as a whole.The purpose of this volume is to provide a Mythology which is not addressed only to specialists - though without losing its scholarly character - but which will be accessible to a wide range of the public; a Mythology which will be read with pleasure by children and adults, by scholars and intellectuals, but also by ordinary people who, without any interest in the specialist questions of academic research, wish to be entertained by discovering what stories the ancient Greeks told about their gods and heroes and to enjoy in a straightforward manner the beauty of the ancient myths.</p><p></p><h2>Miracle in the Mountains: Experiencing the Transforming Power of Faith in the Heart of Appalachia</h2><p>When Lonnie and Belinda Riley return to live in their hometown of Lynch, Kentucky, on a cold March night in 1999, they arrive with no job, no income, and no clue about what to do next. But they do arrive with one certainty: God has called them to leave a comfortable, &#34;make-it-happen&#34; kind of life to live totally dependent on Him to show them how to serve the people in the heart of Appalachia-and that is all they need. As the Rileys learn to live the faith-life, miracle after miracle occurs as God provides in ways that only He can and as He does things only He can do. As word spreads about what is happening, over the next ten years more than 30,000 short- and long-term volunteers come to minister alongside the Rileys in the more than twenty ministries they begin, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in goods and services are donated through Meridzo Center Ministries, Inc.

PETER, BY THE bronze horse of Toledo and the six bishops of Valladolid, I swear that all I put down here is the truth. There is nothing else but the truth in this fateful story. </p> <p>On an April morning of bright skies, after days of gentle rain, I was rousted from dreams with the point of a Toledo blade. It was a friendly jab Don Luis gave me, but meaningful nonetheless.</p> <p>"Father Medina," said Don Luis, "has broken two of his legs. Had he more than two, the good father would have broken them also."</p> <p>"How?" I blurted out. "Where?"</p> <p>"No matter how and where. The legs are broken and I need two more to take their place. Sturdy legs. Yours, Juliï¿½n Escobar. I need them today."</p> <p>Dazed, I sat up and rubbed my eyes.</p> <p>"Why me?" I stammered. "There are others. Father Expoleta, for one."</p> <p>"Father Expoleta is old and, like the old, very set in his thoughts."</p> <p>"But, sir," I said.</p> <p>"Everything is arranged."</p> <p>"But, sir," I repeated, staggering into my woolen shortclothes. "How can I take the place of Father Medina? He is a priest, while I am only a seminarian. I am ignorant of God's ways. I have barely begun my studies."</p> <p>"Your studies can continue in the New World. On the island of<br> Buenaventura."</p> <p>"But my teachers are here," I protested. "My books are here. My friends. My mother. The cathedral of Seville, where I was baptized. The village of Arroyo, where I was born and wish to serve God. All are here, sir."</p> <p>"God resides everywhere. Not here alone, but in the New World also. Even among the savages, who have never heard of Him. Among them especially. It will be your privilege to bring them His love."</p> <p>"Privilege?"</p> <p>"Your duty as a Christian, I should say."</p> <p>"Duty?"</p> <p>"Yes, because you will have power over them. These dark people will stand in awe of you, tall and fair haired as you are. Your voice will charm them as well. And your words, though they do lean toward the Latinate, will cast a spell upon them."</p> <p>"But the words I speak are Spanish."</p> <p>"Words are words. It is the sound of words that alerts the mind and soothes the heart. Not so much the words themselves."</p> <p>As I brushed my hair, glancing in the mirror that hung beside my bunk, I was astonished to see my openmouthed face.</p> <p>"Not to mention your talents as a musician," Don Luis said. "The gittern, which you play sweetly, like an archangel. Like Gabriel himself."</p> <p>I began to quibble. "Gabriel does not play the gittern. He plays a horn."</p> <p>"I see you standing there in the jungle, surrounded by savage hundreds."</p> <p>From the tone of his voice, I think he did see me standing in the jungle surrounded by savages.</p> <p>"I hear your voice. I hear the sweet notes of your gittern dropping like honey. You will save many souls. Hundreds, thousands, far more than you ever will save here."</p> <p>I continued my quibbling, meanwhile summoning the courage to face him down. "I lack clothes for the expedition. Where do I get them?" I said.</p> <p>"Use those of Father Medina, he of the two broken legs, who fell into an open cesspool while walking along in broad daylight, reading. Reading causes many misfortunes."</p> <p>"He is half my size."</p> <p>"We are not going to a fiesta."</p> <p>"But, sir, I am awkward on a horse."</p> <p>"True enough. Therefore, like your beloved Saint Francis, you will walk."</p> <p>"I become seasick," I said.</p> <p>"How do you know? In all your sixteen years, you have never set foot upon the deck of a ship."</p> <p>"Just standing on the shore and watching the waves come and go makes my stomach churn."</p> <p>Don Luis squinted his eyes. It was his manner of smiling. He smiled easily. He could squint his eyes as he stuck a sword smack into your gizzard. Then he sur prised me by touching my shoulder. Although he was only twenty-seven, it was a fatherly hand he laid upon me.</p> <p>"You are so absorbed in your studies," he said, "I doubt you have heard about the island granted to me by my cousin."</p> <p>"I have heard."</p> <p>"Do you know that it is twenty leagues in length and a full nine leagues in width?"</p> <p>I nodded. For the past ten months, since the day the grant was made, there had been much talk about it in our village. In the last month, since Don Luis bought the caravel Santa Margarita, the countryside talked of little else. And the people of Seville knew about it, too. Carts and mules loaded with dried peas, salted fish and beef, oatmeal, firkins of flour, brown biscuits, white biscuits, and casks of wine left the Arroyo farms every week and clattered through the streets on their way to the river dock.</p> <p>"You know," Don Luis continued, "that the island of Buenaventura has thousands of hectares of rich land, where, it is said, anything will grow. You only need to drop a seed on the earth and jump out of the way. Also, trees filled with all kinds of fabulous fruit never served here in Spain."</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"And gold. The Indians pluck it with their fingers from the common ground they tread upon."</p> <p>"Yes, I have heard this. Likewise that these savages make necklaces of gold so heavy it takes a strong man to wear one."</p> <p>"And bowls of gold they eat gruel from."</p> <p>"You will be a rich man," I said, without envy. "Richer than you are now. You will rival the king in riches."</p> <p>I walked to the door and looked out. It was a beautiful morning. A silvery mist lay over the new-plowed fields. Far off, the spires of Seville caught the first rays of the sun. Birds were singing. I turned around to face Don Luis.</p> <p>He slipped his sword in its sheath. He smiled. "We leave Arroyo at noon," he said. "We sail from Seville tomorrow at dawn."</p> <p>I was silent, summoning the courage to speak my mind. It was not easy. Don Luis was a young man ac customed to being obeyed. He had done much for me. When my father had fallen mortally ill, he had forgiven my mother the family debts. Though she was in poor health and could work but little, he kept her on as a servant in his household. It was he who had made it possible for me to attend the seminary of St. Jude.</p> <p>"I am honored that you wish me to go to the New World, but my ties are here," I said, repeating myself. "My companions, my school, and the people I hope to serve someday."</p> <p>Don Luis smiled. "The village of Arroyo," he said, "which you wish to serve, possesses 192 inhabitants. Added to this number are the 107 who work for me, making a total of 299. In New Spain, on the island of Buenaventura, according to what I am told, there are more than two thousand Indians. These are savages who have never heard of God. Who are fated to die without ever knowing Him." A very devout Christian, Don Luis paused to cross himself. "The people of our village need you," he went on, "but the savages of Buenaventura need you more. It is clear to me where your duty lies."</p> <p>"But I'm not a priest. I still have two years of study."</p> <p>"You can continue your studies in New Spain. The bishop of Burgos is my close friend. It was through his influence that I was granted the encomienda. He will ar range this through the church in Hispaniola. What is more, once he takes you under his wing, once you have established yourself as a powerful saver of souls, opportunities you never dreamed of will come your way. You will not be stuck in the village of Arroyo for the rest of your life&#x2014;baptizing babies, marrying the young, burying the old. This I promise you: one day you your self will become a bishop. As powerful as the bishop of Burgos."</p> <p>Looking back now, years after that spring morning, I realize it was then, at the very moment when Don Luis spoke these words and I clearly saw before me a world of service I had never dreamed of before, that I made my decision.</p></p><h2>Classic Millinery Techniques: A Complete Guide to Making &amp; Designing Today's Hats</h2><p>There are over 270 black and white illustrations that show you every part of the process, from the basics to the secrets of professional milliners.</p><p>Several generations ago every woman wore hats.

Not true.</p> <p>My first discovery was that DuBose was a high school dropout and that Dorothy, a young orphan, was unusually well educated and already an award winning playwright when they married. Then I discovered the huge economic disparities between them. Dorothy was wealthy and although DuBose was comfortable at the time they met, he had grown up in poverty. I ran across a copy of her birth certificate, on which her name is &#x201c;Dorothea&#x201d;&#x2014;my name&#x2014;and letterhead that stated she lived on Fifth and Twelfth in Manhattan&#x2014;my old address&#x2014; on and on. Every time I turned around, it seemed I was bumping into another coincidence. Okay, I thought, there&#x2019;s a story here and I&#x2019;m going to try and tell it. Who was <em>Dorothy</em> Heyward? And what happened that summer on Folly Beach?</p> <p>It is historic fact that Dorothy herself adapted DuBose&#x2019;s book <em>Porgy</em> for the stage and that she also had a great hand in creating the adaptation of <em>Mamba&#x2019;s Daughters</em> for the stage, the two most successful works with DuBose Heyward&#x2019;s name attached to them. But she shied away from taking credit for herself and spent her widowhood making sure that DuBose&#x2019;s name appeared in the credits of all of Gershwin&#x2019;s productions of <em>Porgy and Bess</em> so that his estate would receive the royalties that were due.</p> <p>What is in those boxes at the SCHS is there because it was what Dorothy wanted us to see. Every single letter from her to DuBose is absent. Perhaps he did not save her letters or perhaps she disposed of them. We will never know. But it appears that Dorothy wanted us to have a one-sided conversation with DuBose, not her. Dorothy always wanted DuBose to be the celebrity, the icon, the one who was remembered and revered. She loved him that much.</p> <p>And, finally, while Dorothy Heyward may have wanted to disappear into history as &#x201c;just a girl from Ohio who wanted a career on the other side of the footlights,&#x201d; the facts appear differently to me. True, she was diminutive in the extreme, and the fact that she was from Ohio may have left her more easily dismissed by DuBose&#x2019;s crowd of aristocratic old Charlestonians. But Dorothy Kuhns Heyward was a powerhouse, who married into one of Charleston&#x2019;s most prestigious families and spent her life doing everything she could for the man she fiercely loved who was, for his time, a civil rights pioneer. My new novel explores their lifelong collaboration, their devotion to each other and what magic happened on Folly Beach in 1934 and in 2010, both periods of fascinating self-discovery.</p><p>Folly Beach, South Carolina, with its glistening beaches, laidback Southern charm, and enticing Gullah tradition, is the land of Cate Cooper's childhood, the place where all the ghosts of her past roam freely.

Author Steven Levy, deservedly famous for his enlightening <i>Hackers</i>, tells the story of the cypherpunks, their foes, and their allies in <i>Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government</i>. From the determined research of Whitfield Diffie and Marty Hellman, in the face of the NSA's decades-old security lock, to the commercial world's turn-of-the-century embrace of encrypted e-commerce, Levy finds drama and intellectual challenge everywhere he looks. Although he writes, "Behind every great cryptographer, it seems, there is a driving pathology," his respect for the mathematicians and programmers who spearheaded public key encryption as the solution to Information Age privacy invasion shines throughout. Even the governmental bad guys are presented more as hapless control fetishists who lack the prescience to see the inevitability of strong encryption as more than a conspiracy of evil.<p> Each cryptological advance that was made outside the confines of the NSA's Fort Meade complex was met with increasing legislative and judicial resistance. Levy's storytelling acumen tugs the reader along through mathematical and legal hassles that would stop most narratives in their tracks--his words make even the depressingly silly Clipper chip fiasco vibrant. Hardcore privacy nerds will value <i>Crypto</i> as a review of 30 years of wrangling; those readers with less familiarity with the subject will find it a terrific and well-documented launching pad for further research. From notables like Phil Zimmerman to obscure but important figures like James Ellis, <i>Crypto</i> dishes the dirt on folks who know how to keep a secret. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Steven Levy is the author of Hackers, which has been in print for more than fifteen years, as well as <i>Insanely Great: The Life &amp; Times of Macintosh</i>, <i>the Computer That Changed Everything</i>.

Rich with Berry's personal experience of life as a Kentucky agrarian, the collection includes portraits of a few of America's most imaginative writers, including James Still, Hayden Carruth, Jane Kenyon, John Haines, and several others.</p></p><p>*Starred Review* The essays of Berry&#x2019;s new collection are of two kinds. Most are short appreciations of other writers who have taught him, formally (Wallace Stegner) as well as in the way all writers teach those who respond to them, as exemplary observers of humanity and truth. These small pieces&#x2019; subjects include, besides novelist Stegner, poets John Haines, Hayden Carruth, and Jane Kenyon; fellow Kentuckians James Still, Gurney Norman, and James Baker Hall (the last a fine photographer, to boot)&#x2014;all personal acquaintances and friends of Berry&#x2019;s&#x2014;California&#x2019;s Buddhist-ecologist bard, Gary Snyder; and the great English poet and scholar of Blake and Yeats, Kathleen Raine, whom he knows primarily from their work. The longer pieces weigh in with congenial gravity on how it has been to live and work in the same place for 40-some years; the effects of the Civil War on literature and public consciousness, especially in his own region, the upper South; self-knowledge and adversity in As You Like It and King Lear; and a typical scientist&#x2019;s rant against theism. The Shakespearean piece, rebutting currently fashionable &#x201c;dark&#x201d; interpretations, particularly of Lear, is very probably destined to be a classic essay, while the concluding defense of belief and science rather obviates one side of the religion-science controversy while demolishing the other. --Ray OlsonPraise for <i>Imagination in Place</i><br><br>"Berry's latest collection of essays is the reminiscence of a literary life.

Robyn and her husband live in Las Vegas, Nevada. You can visit Robyn Carr&#x2019;s website at www.RobynCarr.com.June Hudson had nerves of steel. She was thirty-seven years old, had been the town doctor in Grace Valley, California, for over ten years and the things she'd been called upon to do were not for the faint of heart. June had delivered a baby in the back of a pickup truck, kept a logger's severed limb on ice waiting for the emergency helicopter and had given calm, intelligent medical advice while looking down the barrel of a marijuana farmer's gun. Oh, she was feminine enough, but tough. Strong. Fearless.<p>Maybe not fearless, but she had certainly learned how to <i>appear </i>fearless. She had learned this in Omnipotent Physician 101.</p><p>Then came an early morning phone call bearing portentous news that caused her heart to race and her brow and upper lip to bead with sweat. All the strength bled out of her legs as she sank helplessly to the kitchen stool.</p><p>The conversation started out innocently enough with her friend Birdie reporting, "Chris is coming home with the boys." Chris was Birdie's son, the boys her twin fourteen-year-old grandsons.</p><p>"For a visit?" June half asked, half assumed.</p><p>"For good, he says. He and Nancy are divorcing."</p><p>June was silent. Shocked. Dismayed. <i>Divorcing? </i></p><p>"He asked if you were still single," Birdie went on, a lilt to her chipper voice. A hopeful little lilt.</p><p>That was when June the Fearless began to tremble and quake. Chris was an old boyfriend. In fact, her first love. Also her first and most terrible broken heart. Chris Forrest was the man June always vowed she would tie up and torture for the agony he had brought to her youth.</p><p>The only son of Birdie and Judge Forrest, Chris had lived in southern California for eighteen or so years, married to another high-school friend&#x2014;or rival&#x2014; Nancy Cruise. He had only returned to Grace Valley for visits a few times; his parents enjoyed their trips to his home in San Diego. During his rare appearances, June did her best to avoid him. When she did happen upon him, she was as cool as a cucumber, aloof and detached. Her posture and expression said that bygones were bygones, that she rarely even thought about him.</p><p>It was partly true. She didn't spend a great deal of time mooning over a twenty-year-old romance gone awry. On the other hand, whenever she saw him, she was instantly reminded of two things: right after high school he had dumped her for Nancy without explanation or apology, and his boyish good looks had not deserted him. She hated him on both counts.</p><p>And now, divorced, he wondered if she was available? Hah! In your dreams, Chris Forrest, she thought with the long-lasting venom of a lover scorned.</p><p>She made a little small talk with Birdie, who was quite naturally excited by this turn of events. After hanging up the phone June remained on the kitchen stool, dazed, her thoughts concentrated mainly on planning Chris's slow death. Then the phone rang again.</p><p>"Chris Forrest is moving back to Grace Valley," her father, Elmer, reported.</p><p>"Really?" she faked. "Birdie and Judge must be delighted."</p><p>"Seems he split with Nancy and has custody of his kids, which I suppose makes sense, them being boys and all."</p><p>"How nice."</p><p>"Divorced," Elmer clarified.</p><p>"I didn't mean that part was nice," June said. "Him coming back here with sons. That's nice. Especially for Birdie and Judge."</p><p>"Does that put a little flush in your cheeks?" Elmer wanted to know. "Him being single again?"</p><p>She felt her cheeks, which were aflame, but not with the heat of passion. Could her father actually imagine she'd welcome the lout back into her arms? "Certainly not. That was a childhood thing. I've been over that for a couple of decades now."</p><p>"That so?" Elmer wanted to know. "Meat loaf tonight at your place?"</p><p>"Dad? Did you happen to hear when they're coming back?"</p><p>"I believe Judge said right away, as Chris wants to get his boys signed up for school. So...meat loaf? It's Tuesday again already."</p><p>"Right away?" She absently touched her hair, still damp from the shower. She'd never been good at things like hair. She could get an inflamed appendix out in no time and leave a scar that would be the envy of a plastic surgeon, but her dark blond, shoulder-length hair&#x2014;or dishwater blond, as her mother used to call it&#x2014;was beyond her understanding.</p><p>Nancy had always had great hair: thick, richly brown, long, shiny.</p><p>June looked at her hands. Doctor's hands. Short nails, pink knuckles from scrubbing them dozens of times a day, and...what was that? An <i>age </i>spot?</p><p>She had heard that Chris, Nancy and their boys belonged to a country club.</p><p>"I'll see you here at about six, Dad."</p><p>"You okay, June? You sound awfully tired. You go out on calls last night?"</p><p>She heard a familiar alarm from her bedroom when her pager, set to vibrate, began dancing around on top of the bedside stand. Grrrr. With the cordless phone at her ear, she dashed to get it. "No, I wasn't called out at all. It was a quiet night. Oops, gotta go, Dad. I've got a page. See you later?"</p><p>"Later," he agreed.</p><p>The pager revealed the number for the police department, with a 911 attached to indicate an emergency. Chris Forrest disappeared as June went into a different mind-set and dialed. "June here," she said.</p><p>Deputy Ricky Rios had paged her. "Chief Toopeek responded to a call about a shooting at the Culley stables, June. Said he needs you out there as soon as possible."</p><p>"Is Tom calling for the paramedics or a helicopter?" she asked while slipping on her shoes.</p><p>"He just asked for you," Ricky said.</p><p>June grabbed her bag and a clip for her damp hair, whistled for her collie, Sadie, and was out the door in under fifteen seconds. She was on call, a service she shared with John Stone, the other Grace Valley physician, and therefore drove the town's new ambulance. It was so new that it still intimidated her, and though she turned on the lights and siren, she didn't drive any faster than usual. It was early morning; she didn't want to hit an animal or round a curve in the road and slam into slow-moving farm equipment.</p><p>Even though June now had a radio at her disposal, she didn't use it to contact Tom Toopeek to ask about the shooting, because many of the citizens in Grace Valley also had radios. It was like a big party line. Of course, with the way everyone minded everyone else's business in the town, she might as well get on the radio and give them a heads up. They'd have all the details by lunchtime anyway.</p><p>Daniel and Blythe Culley lived in a medium-size, ordinary ranch house on acreage large enough to support two stables that were by no means ordinary, five corrals, and still provide plentiful grazing land at the foothills of the Coast Ranges mountains. Horse people from Kentucky, they had started out small but a decade or so back they'd had great success with a stallion racing in San Francisco and San Diego, and the reputation of the stable had soared. Boarders, breeders, trainers and sometimes racers, they employed as many as twenty hands, depending on how many horses they had in residence. Clients came from everywhere and the Culleys were kept busy year-round.</p><p>June didn't speculate much on what might have happened. Nearly everyone in the valley had guns, especially if they lived in the country and had to contend with wildlife. One of the hands might have had a mishap or, less likely, a disagreement that led to a showdown. Rushing to the stables, she thought abstractedly about the Culleys and the kind of people they were&#x2014;salt of the earth. It came to mind how happy and devoted a couple they had always been. Quiet, but friendly and helpful. They kept to themselves, since building up a stable of some repute required backbreaking commitment. Farmers, ranchers, vintners, loggers and the like worked from dawn to dusk, slept hard and worked more. A strong partnership, a strong marriage, like what the Culleys had, was required. June thought it such a pity that they hadn't had children to raise on their land. They'd have made admirable parents.</p><p>Although it was now 7:00 a.m., the tall trees caused the sun to slant weakly into the yard and an eerie cloud of fog lingered in front of the house. Tom's Range Rover was parked about a hundred yards from the house and he stood beside it, his rifle balanced in a nonthreatening way upon his right shoulder. A barrel had been tipped onto its side and Daniel lay over it, his pants pulled unceremoniously down to his thighs, his buttocks, freckled with buckshot, catching the cool morning breeze.</p><p>"Daniel, what the heck...?" she began, getting out of the ambulance with her bag in hand.</p><p>"That old woman's lost her mind," he said.</p><p>"<i>Blythe </i>did this to you?"</p><p>"You know any other crazy old woman out here?" he wanted to know.</p><p>"Well, I&#x2014;" First of all, she thought, they're not old. Blythe was around fifty-five, Daniel maybe a little bit older. It was hard to tell. They were a young couple when they'd moved to Grace Valley, and June hadn't had occasion to treat either one of them. That in itself had never been curious to her until that moment. Why would they travel to another town for their medical needs? Had they not trusted her father, Elmer, the town doctor before her? They were quite friendly with Elmer. Perhaps, unlike most of the townsfolk, they didn't <i>want </i>a doctor with whom they were well acquainted.</p><p>"Where is Blythe?" she finally asked.</p><p>Tom, not uttering a word, tipped his rifle slightly in the direction of the house. There, through the morning mist, June could see Blythe sitting in a rocking chair on the porch, the gun lying comfortably across her lap.</p><p>"Have you talked to her?" she asked Tom.</p><p>"Just from a safe distance. It appears she needs a little time to think about things."</p><p>"You let that woman think much longer," Daniel said, "she's likely to stomp down here and put the muzzle to my head, which I should have had examined about thirty years ago for getting into this bargain."</p><p>June looked at his pocked, inflamed backside. "I'm going to have to take you to the clinic, Daniel. We'll need some antiseptic and bandages...and nice, fine tweezers. But you'll be all right." She coughed lightly and behind her hand she...</p></p><h2>Frank Furness: The Complete Works, Revised Edition</h2><p>Frank Furness is unquestionably the most unique and prolific American architect of the 19th century. An apprentice in the atelier of Richard Morris Hunt, Furness in turn became a mentor for Louis Sullivan, who brought Furness's distinctive style to the Midwest. Furness permeated Philadelphia architecture, ultimately shaping the present "Philadelphia School" centered around Louis Kahn and Robert Venturi. <p><i>Frank Furness: The Complete Works</i> is the only exhaustive monograph on Furness's work. More than 640 projects are presented through over 600 photographs and drawings.</p></p><p>Frank Furness was the most unique and prolific American architect of the nineteenth century. Apprenticed in the atelier of Richard Morris Hunt and inspired by the values of his father&#39;s friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Furness derived architectural form from the representation of purpose and turned architecture away from history toward the forces of the present. This encyclopedic book is the first complete monograph of Furness&#39;s work. More than 670 projects are presented through 700 photographs and drawings. Critical essays by George Thomas link Furness to Emersonian naturalism and to the political reform movement in Philadelphia that supported his independent stylistic direction; Jeffrey Cohen explores the personal style and motives of the architect; and Michael Lewis assesses local and national criticism of Furness and the changing perception of style-based history. An introduction by Robert Venturi offers a personal appreciation of the work of this remarkable architect.Thomas is Lecturer of Historical Preservation and Urban Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>Jeffrey A.

Do we, as sentient beings, have the right to confine other sentient beings behind bars, depriving them of their freedom, their natural pleasures and their chance to roam? Is the intention of zoos to satisfy our voyeuristic inclinations or to act as an essential part of conservation efforts?<br>Britta Jaschinski's exquisite photographs are not meant explicitly to answer any questions - but they do make us think. They owe their inspiration to portraiture rather than documentation, creating an atmosphere rather than making a statement. Shrouded in darkness, dimly seen, the animals in these photographs have a shadowy, almost enigmatic, presence that excites our curiosity and draws us in. Our glimpses of them tend to be partial, fragmentary - from a furry hand gripping an iron bar to sea lions floating just below the surface of a pool. Polar bears stare from a rocky stage, a zebra stands stock still and quiet. All of them have a melancholy dignity, commanding a sense of respect in the viewer which is tinged with unease.<br>Jaschinski's involvement and empathy is evident throughout but she never allows it to intrude. Instead she has given us an arresting series of pictures and created a beautiful and important book.</p><p>This book is not for children, nor is it likely to be recycled as a calendar or a booklet of postcards. It has, however, established its young creator as a talent on the rise in Europe. Jaschinski, a German-born photographer based in London, lets her stark black-and-white compositions stand without commentary; viewers are left to form their own opinions. Among these dark and unsettling images of animals behind bars is a haunting--and nearly heart-breaking--picture of a decidedly unhappy gibbon, imploring the camera to free him from captivity. Words could only diminish its impact.Britta Jaschinski (b.1965) was born in Bremen and has lived and worked in England since 1990. Her body of work on animals won her instant recognition which resulted in exhibitions throughout the world, including a solo show at London&#39;s Photographers&#39; Gallery in 1995.</p><h2>The Liberation of the Philippines: Luzon, Midanao, Visagas 1944 - 1945</h2><p>Recounts the role of the United States in World War II at sea, from encounters in the Atlantic before the country entered the war to the surrender of Japan</p><p></p><h2>All the Stories of Muriel Spark</h2><p><p><strong>Four brand new tales are now added to New Directions' original 1997 cloth edition of <em>Open to the Public</em>.</strong></p> This new and complete paperback edition now contains every one of her forty-one marvelous stories, catnip for all Spark fans. <em>All the Stories of Muriel Spark</em> spans Dame Muriel Spark's entire career to date and displays all her signature stealth, originality, beauty, elegance, wit, and shock value.No writer commands so exhilarating a style&#x2015;playful and rigorous, cheerful and venomous, hilariously acute and coolly supernatural. Ranging from South Africa to the West End, her dazzling stories feature hanging judges, fortune-tellers, shy girls, psychiatrists, dress designers, pensive ghosts, imaginary chauffeurs, and persistent guests. Regarding one story ("The Portobello Road"), Stephen Schiff said in <em>The New Yorker</em>: "Muriel Spark has written some of the best sentences in English. For instance: 'He looked as if he would murder me, and he did.' It's a nasty piece of work, that sentence."</p><p>Muriel Spark (1918&#x2013;2006) was the author of dozens of novels, including The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Memento Mori, A Far Cry from Kensington, The Girls of Slender Means, The Ballad of Peckham Rye, The Driver&#x2019;s Seat, and many more. She became Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.Coming just four years after the cloth edition of Open to the Public: New and Collected Stories, which introduced readers to 10 new Spark tales, this collection tacks on four slight additions and brings the total of Spark's stories to 41. The new entries are brief variations on familiar Stark themes: social standing is comically depicted in "The Snobs," the ownership of family history is probed through photographs in "A Hundred and Eleven Years Without a Chauffeur" and benign ghostly experiences account for the remaining two stories. Taken together, they're not a major inducement for owners of the 1997 collection to indulge again so soon. Those who know Spark mainly from her novels, however (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie; Loitering with Intent), will be pleased to snap up this treasure trove, markedly best for the many of her earlier stories that combine elements that other writers wouldn't dare bring together. Chance encounters between strangers spiral into unexpected plots (as when a young woman meets a soldier on a train in "The House of the Famous Poet"), and Spark's narrators (including the wry, level-headed ghost of "The Portobello Road") serve as astute observers of race, class and society, particularly in the stories set in colonial South Africa. There are times when the whimsy goes screwball, and briefer pieces stemming from a word or phrase peter out, but overall Spark's marvelous control of ambiguities and language continues to dazzle. (Nov. 29)Forecast: Following so soon on the heels of Open to the Public, this volume may not receive much review coverage, but as the first paperback collected edition since 1985, it should sell well, particularly to students and first-time Spark readers. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California, 1945-1960</h2><p>Over the last half century, New York's preeminence in the world of jazz has been challenged only once--during the 1950s--when California emerged with a splash on the jazz scene. "West Coast jazz," as it soon became known, was a fresh new sound which stirred both controversy and excitement in equal measure. One thing, however, was certain: never before (or since) had so many jazz musicians from the Coast made such an impact on jazz. Dave Brubeck, Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper, Chet Baker, Eric Dolphy, Paul Desmond, Ornette Coleman, Cal Tjader, Shelly Manne, and numerous others--these figures shaped the jazz of their time and are still powerful influences today.<br> In <em>West Coast Jazz</em>, Ted Gioia provides the definitive account of this rich, evocative music. Drawing on years of research and numerous first-hand interviews, Gioia tells the full story of West Coast jazz, from its early stirrings on Central Avenue--the heart of LA's post-World War II black culture--to its decline after 1960. The decade-long renaissance of West Coast jazz remains one of the great stories of jazz history, and nobody has told it as well as Ted Gioia does here. His love of this music shines on every page.</p><p>"A book that desperately needed to be written and has turned out to be a surprise landmark and masterpiece."&nbsp;--Bruce and Joel Klauber, <i>Jazziz</i>&nbsp;"Gioia writes with the musical knowledge of a jazzman and the immediacy of a reporter, in language that has a casual grace."&nbsp;--Bill Kisliuk, San Francisco Review of Books&nbsp;"Ted Gioia is very much a West Coast jazz partisan, and his informed enthusiasm and wide-ranging research make West Coast Jazz a highly rewarding and arguable book. . . . Makes a large, disparate, unruly subject not only coherent but also intriguing."&nbsp;--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;"While the requisite space is devoted to such cool icons as Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker, Gioia also takes an expert, often iconoclastic look at the careers of other West Coast jazz men, both well-known and obscure. . . . Anyone looking for a basic history of the California scene should start with this smart, opinionated book."&nbsp;--Chris Morris, <i>Billboard</i><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Ted Gioia</strong> was born in Los Angeles in 1957. He was a founder of Stanford's Jazz Studies program and has taught jazz history and performance there.

His first book, <em>The Imperfect Art</em>, was a winner of The ASCAP Deems-Taylor Award.<br></p><h2>Every Woman I&#39;Ve Ever Loved: Lesbian Writers on Their Mothers</h2><p>&#34;I have wanted to find my mother in every woman I&#39;ve ever loved,&#34; writes Catherine Reid in the introduction to this refreshingly complex and original anthology. &#34;I have ached to find traces of her smell, her touch, the way she would cradle the back of my head, her songs. I had to turn forty before I could admit that to myself or acknowledge how often a similar yearning shows up in the people around me. Relationships with mothers are complicated for everyone - men and women, heterosexual, gay and bisexual. But for lesbians, that core relationship is especially powerful, blessed (or burdened) with a multiplicity of emotions and desires. In Every Woman I&#39;ve Ever Loved, an impressive line-up of lesbian authors examines the mother/daughter relationship .... in essays, poems and dramatic monoloogues, and even one photo essay. As women who love women, these writers bring passionate intensity and complicated depths to this fundamental, first love.

About half of the 28 essays in this book, by writers such as Audre Lorde, Joan Nestle, and Dorothy Allison, have been previously published; the other half were written for this anthology. Mab Segrest writes eloquently and sadly about her dead mother's relation to Segrest's writing and anti-racist activism. The excerpt from Holly Hughes's <i>World Without End</i> captures the giddy nervousness of a daughter seeing her mother naked. Shay Youngblood's spare vignette describes the affinity between a mother and daughter whose bodies are breaking. <i>Every Woman I've Ever Loved</i> is an extremely powerful collection, best read slowly with time for weeping.Refreshingly complex look at the relationship between lesbians and their mothers.</p><h2>Lucy on the Loose (A Stepping Stone Book)</h2><p>When Bobby Quinn got a beagle puppy for his eighth birthday, his whole life changed.

The eerie events of that epochal Independence Day suggested the intervention of supernatural forces, mixing death and dedication in such powerful ways that observers of all faiths, and of no faith, saw evidence of destiny&#x2019;s direction in American affairs. Even now, after nearly two hundred years of turbulent history, recollections of that &#x201c;Glorious Fourth&#x201d; can compel the most skeptical scholars to acknowledge weird, wonderful aspects in the rise of the Republic, and to reconsider the disconcerting old idea that God shows special tenderness toward the American experiment.</p><p>On the occasion of the fiftieth Fourth of July, such confidence in providential protection seemed not only logical but unavoidable. After all, the older citizens of the federal Union had already witnessed a half century of miracles, highlighted by the new nation&#x2019;s prodigious growth and unprecedented prosperity. Americans viewed themselves as a chosen people, selected for special responsibilities to accompany their special blessings, and so looked to biblical references to establish the proper context for major public celebrations.</p><p>The preparations for the anniversary repeatedly invoked the Old Testament notion of jubilee, citing a well-known verse in Leviticus: &#x201c;And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you&#x201d; (25:10). After all, a portion of this same verse had been inscribed onto the Liberty Bell itself--already a cherished national icon just two generations after it reputedly rang out in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Independence Hall to celebrate signing of the Declaration.</p><p>A half century later, leaders in every corner of the country arranged for pealing bells in cities, villages, and crossroads churches, in recognition of the breathtaking growth of the young Republic. The most recent census showed almost twelve million inhabitants--nearly five times the population that had launched a world-changing revolution. Even more dramatic, a loose coalition of thirteen thinly settled colonies, clinging to a relatively narrow band of territory at the edge of the Atlantic, had given way to twenty-four flourishing states with plausible dreams of an American empire someday reaching all the way to the Pacific.</p><p>In the midst of this dizzying change, Americans of the era clung to their precious remaining connections to the nation&#x2019;s heroic origins, expressing special gratitude for the unlikely survival of the two titans who had played the most prominent roles in declaring independence. At a time when male life expectancy barely reached forty years, John Adams, the &#x201c;Atlas of Independence&#x201d; and the second president of the United States, had passed his ninetieth birthday with his faculties and health remarkably intact. From his ancestral home outside of Boston, he watched with passionate engagement as his oldest son (and intellectual soul mate) presided over the government in faraway Washington as the sixth president. In fact, one of the former chief executive&#x2019;s doctors reported that the inauguration of his son in 1825 actually enhanced the old man&#x2019;s strength and vitality. &#x201c;But physicians do not always consider how much the powers of the mind, and what is called good spirits, can recover the lost energies of the body,&#x201d; wrote Benjamin Waterhouse to President John Quincy Adams. &#x201c;I really believe that your father&#x2019;s revival is mainly owing to the demonstration that his son has not served an ungrateful public.&#x201d;</p><p>Six hundred miles away, at the elegant hilltop plantation house he had designed for himself, Adams&#x2019;s old friend (and sometime bitter rival) Thomas Jefferson also defied the actuarial tables. At eighty-three, the third president struggled with various digestive and urinary tract afflictions, but he received frequent visitors and maintained a prolific correspondence, commenting eloquently on current affairs. He told his grandson that &#x201c;I am like an old watch, with a pinion worn out here, and a wheel there, until I can go no longer.&#x201d; He also carefully prepared for his own demise, penning a valedictory poem to his adored surviving daughter, enclosing it in a simple, elegant box she opened only after his death:</p><p>Then farewell, my dear, my lov&#x2019;d daughter, adieu!</p><p>The last pang of life is in parting from you!</p><p>Yet even with his intensifying focus on his own mortality, Jefferson expressed a fierce determination to survive one more Fourth of July so that &#x201c;he might breathe the air of the Fiftieth Anniversary.&#x201d;</p><p>As the great day approached, organizers of the elaborate public festivities in all of the nation&#x2019;s most important cities turned their attention to Adams and Jefferson as potential guests to lend historic weight to their celebrations. In the Continental Congress of 1776, it had been Adams who led the relentless fight for independence and who, once he had succeeded, recommended his young friend Jefferson to draft the declaration that would explain the decision to a wondering world. Now, of the fifty-six patriots who had affixed their signatures to that final document, only these two and one more--eighty-eight-year-old Charles Carroll of Maryland--were alive to see the half-century commemoration of their handiwork.</p><p>Despite pleas from every corner of the country, frail health and the rigors of travel made the journey unthinkable for each of the old men. Adams would have dearly loved to join his son at the White House to preside together over the capital&#x2019;s Grand Jubilee, but a journey to Washington would have consumed more than five days, rattling over rough roads in stiflingly hot stagecoaches and making brief water passages on belching, filthy steamboats.</p><p>Instead, he received visitors in the sprawling, comfortably cluttered two-story Quincy residence, Peacefield, he had called home since 1788. He had inhabited the house for the quarter century since disillusioned voters turned him out of the White House after his single term, following an exceptionally nasty and painfully personal campaign waged against him by followers of Jefferson, his old friend. Adams and his wife, Abigail, first acquired the structure and its forty acres of verdant fields and orchards at the conclusion of his diplomatic service in Europe following the Revolution; it stood just down a country road from the modest saltbox home in which he had been born and raised, and from the similarly unassuming neighboring structure in which his son John Quincy first opened his eyes to the New England sunlight. The old man still owned both buildings and hoped to keep them in the family for perpetuity. His beloved Abigail had left him a widower eight years before with her reported last words, &#x201c;Do not grieve, my friend, my dearest friend. I am ready to go. And John, it will not be long.&#x201d; She rested now in the local churchyard, where her husband of fifty-four years meant to join her when his time came.</p><p>Leaders from Boston hoped to lure the old lion to the festive commemorations they had planned in the nearby city, but Adams declined to make the ten-mile trip. He even turned down the local Independence Day committee from Quincy, though he provided them with a sharply worded letter they could read aloud at the upcoming anniversary. He wrote: &#x201c;My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind.&#x201d;</p><p>The committee of his neighbors, perhaps hoping that the great man would reconsider his participation in commemorations so close to his home, came calling at Peacefield a few days later. They asked Adams to suggest a toast that could be presented in his honor on the holiday. &#x201c;I will give you,&#x201d; he said without hesitation, &#x201c;independence forever.&#x201d;</p><p>After a moment of silence, his respectful visitors asked if he might consider adding something further. He leaned on his cane and scowled back at them from under his halo of white hair. &#x201c;Not a word,&#x201d; he crisply replied.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;RAYS OF RAVISHING LIGHT AND GLORY&#x201d;</p><p>His friend Thomas Jefferson felt no similar reluctance to discourse at length. When Mayor Roger Weightman of Washington, D.C., invited all living former presidents--Adams, Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe--to attend the festival planned for the seat of government, each respectfully declined, citing the infirmities of age. The &#x201c;Sage of Monticello,&#x201d; however, carefully composed a public response that promptly appeared in newspapers around the country and created a national sensation in the weeks before the holiday. He wrote at a desk in his sun-dappled chamber, where a plaster bust of Adams rested on a shelf and overlooked his colleague&#x2019;s work with assumed approbation. Jefferson wrote:</p><p>I should, indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and exchanged there congratulations, personally, with the small band, the remnant of that host of worthies who joined with us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were to make, for our country, between submission and the sword; and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact that our fellow citizens, after half a century of experience and prosperity, continue to approve the choice we made. May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. The form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of men. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few, booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others; for ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollection of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.<br><br></p><p>With this elegantly crafted testament of faith in the work of his own Revolutionary cohort, Jefferson managed, as he always did, to upstage his old friend. Even John Adams&#x2019;s son, the president of the United States, read Jefferson&#x2019;s words and pronounced himself impressed by the elderly Virginian&#x2019;s vigor of language and clarity of mind.</p><p>But it had been the elder Adams, not the more effusive Jefferson, who first predicted the way a grateful nation would come to rejoice over their bold gamble on nationhood. In an exultant letter to his wife, Abigail, back home in Boston, the irascible and tireless patriot had described a fateful day of decision at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1776 and then recorded an uncanny burst of prophecy, shockingly typical of our founding fathers. The delegate from Massachusetts declared that the second day of July, when his congressional colleagues first voted to authorize permanent separation from the mother country, would become known as&nbsp;the most memorable epocha in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to another, from this time forward forevermore. You will think me transported with enthusiasm but I am not. I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure it will cost us to maintain this Declaration and to support and defend these states. Yet through all the gloom, I can see rays of ravishing light and glory.<br><br></p><p>REJECTING MR. JEFFERSON&#x2019;S &#x201c;SEDITIOUS PAPER&#x201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, it took more than a generation for those rays to shine in a healing, benevolent fashion on the implacably warring factions that afflicted the new nation. To a startling extent, partisanship undermined the development of a national holiday and even spoiled appreciation of the Declaration, which was indelibly associated with its principal author, Jefferson, a profoundly controversial figure for most of his political career. The Federalists who controlled the national government between 1789 and 1801 felt no inclination to honor Jefferson&#x2019;s masterpiece, considering its language too explicitly anti-British and suspiciously, if vaguely, pro-French. On July 4, 1800, two ministers ostentatiously walked out of a public worship service honoring independence when one of their young students insisted on reading aloud from Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s &#x201c;seditious paper.&#x201d;</p><p>Within a year, one of the most vitriolic elections in American history brought the Jeffersonians into full control in the capital. The new president delivered a famously conciliatory inaugural address, attempting to defuse wild talk of disunion and resistance from some of the indignant Adams loyalists. &#x201c;Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle,&#x201d; Thomas Jefferson declared. &#x201c;We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.&#x201d; Nevertheless, his triumphal followers displayed a fervent determination to exclude their vanquished foes from their strictly partisan Fourth of July balls and banquets, much as they themselves had been excluded in previous years.</p><p>Only with the presidency of James Monroe (1817&#x2013;25) did the nation finally welcome the &#x201c;Era of Good Feelings,&#x201d; in which even the most strident politicos could put aside contempt for the opposition long enough to jointly fire cannon, march in flag-waving parades, gorge themselves at public banquets, and toast the Republic with brimming silver bowls of rum in community-wide celebrations of Independence Day. In part, this development reflected the disappearance of the most divisive issue of America&#x2019;s early years: the ongoing world war between Britain and France in which competing U.S. factions took opposite sides. With Napoleon&#x2019;s definitive defeat in 1815, the old Federalists and their heirs had no more reason to fear the rampages of imperial or revolutionary France, just as Jefferson&#x2019;s Democratic-Republican minions felt less inclination toward bitterness against the globally victorious British Empire they had battled in both a bloody revolution and the War of 1812. Monroe won reelection with no organized opposition, and during his second term even aging political warriors, most notably Adams and Jefferson, began to embrace the idea that their common values and shared experiences counted for more than ideological distinctions or colliding ambitions</p><p>After all, the most discerning among them understood that the rising Republic faced more dangerous divisions than...</p></p><h2>With the Master: Before the Mirror of God&#39;s Word (With the Master Bible Studies)</h2><p>Susan Heck expounds on the book of First John with the same love and tenderness the Apostle John used in writing the book. The theme of the book is expressed well in 1 John 2:1: &#34;My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.

The news about God is called the &#x201c;Gospel&#x201d; (good news) because God&#x2019;s character is loving, kind, patient, impartial, just, right and clearly made known. In short the truth about God is good because He is good... recognizably good. Those who selflessly provide for others in need are called &#x201c;good&#x201d; for a reason and it is for this same reason that we call God &#x201c;good.&#x201d; We are not saying this out of obligation or fear of punishment, but because we recognize His goodness by what He does. A biblically recognizable characteristic of goodness is one&#x2019;s willingness to provide for those in need and that is what God does though His Son, Jesus Christ. Though we believe God&#x2019;s ways can be mysterious at times, we maintain that questionable instances revealed to us in the Scripture can be reasonably explained as consistent with His good character. The Bible clearly demonstrates the loving character of a God who treats His creation in a recognizably good way; a God who does not arbitrarily play favorites or show biased partiality; a God who makes Himself known in a clear and believable way; a God who is not most glorified at the expense of His creation, but at the expense of Himself for the sake of His creation; a God who demonstrates His love by providing the means of salvation for every individual, not because He has to, but because of who He is!This book will answer such questions as: What about those who never hear the gospel? How can we say God is good when He seems so harsh in some of the stories within Scripture? What does it mean to call God good if we do not actually recognize Him as good?</p><p></p><h2>Joel Meyerowitz: Where I Find Myself: A Lifetime Retrospective</h2><p><em>Where I Find Myself</em> is the first major single book retrospective of one of America's leading photographers.

Highway 78, from Julian to the Salton Sea, traversing the watershed of San Felipe Wash and its tributaries, has been a major corridor of travel since the late 1800s. As an E-W corridor, it is a notable exception to historic routes of travel in the Anza-Borrego region, which generally follow NW/SE-trending earthquake faults.</p><br><p>Highway 78 slices across the following faults: Elsinore fault at Banner, Earthquake Valley fault at Scissors Crossing, San Felipe fault at the Narrows, Yaqui Ridge detachment fault at Nude Wash, Coyote Creek fault at Ocotillo Wells, and Superstition Hills fault near Trifolium (junction of Hwys 78 and 86). Highway 78 generally follows the path of Banner and San Felipe Creeks, which are antecedent streams, present before tectonic uplift. Subsequent uplift was slow enough to permit the flowing water to cut downward as fast as the rock barriers arose. Consequently, Hwy 78 is never more than a couple of miles from San Felipe Creek except for the creek&#x2019;s northward loop around Borrego Mountain, which is influenced by the Coyote Creek fault.</p><br><p>As a recreational corridor, Hwy 78 is the central entrance to the Anza-Borrego area. The park&#x2019;s second-largest campground, Tamarisk Grove, is located on this corridor, as is Ocotillo Wells, in Lower Borrego Valley, which is a popular recreational focal point for off-roaders and desert explorers. Ocotillo Wells features Borrego Mountain to the northwest, the Ocotillo Wells State Vehicular Recreation Area (OWSVRA) to the north, and the Split Mountain/Fish Creek area to the south. Farther east the R9/R10 Poleline Road (BLM Road EC191) offers access to the San Felipe Hills and the San Sebastian Marsh. Highway 86 forms the eastern boundary of the region, connecting Hwys S-22 and 78.</p><br><p>Sentenac Cienega (marsh) and canyon, at the western gate to ABDSP, deserve particular attention because of the special effort that the Anza-Borrego Foundation (ABF) spearheaded to preserve this unique riparian area, one of the last undeveloped wetlands in California and an area that park visionaries had hoped to include as a 220-acre &#x201c;scenic easement&#x201d; in the original boundaries in 1933. Preserving this area for future generations was a cooperative effort by several major agencies and groups, including the California State Parks, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Caltrans.</p><br><p>The abundance of water in the marsh and canyon supports a lush plant growth, including two rare and threatened plant communities, the Mesquite Bosque and the Sonoran Cottonwood Willow Riparian Forest. The cienega and canyon have long been a favorite haunt for students of botany. As early as 1832, English botanist Thomas Coulter collected screwbean mesquite and noted the variety of plants in and near the cienega. Many animals, including the endangered least Bell&#x2019;s vireo, the three-spined stickleback warm-water fish, the southwestern willow flycatcher, and the desert bighorn sheep, depend on this permanent water supply. Over 33 sensitive species have been identified in this area. Bird life in Sentenac Cienega and Sentenac Canyon is outstanding in spring. The marsh is also a premiere area for butterflies, including the Eunus skipper, the Sonoran blue, the striated queen, and the migratory monarch. This riparian area was also a focus of attention for early Indians and later homesteaders.</p><br><p>In the early 1990s, preliminary discussions began between the current owners of the property and ABF about the possibility of acquiring this unique wetlands area as an addition to the state park. The actual acquisition became a reality in 1998, realizing the dreams of park visionaries Guy L. Fleming and Newton B. Drury, some 65 years earlier.</p><br><p><b>Trip 4A: Earthquake (Shelter) Valley to Ocotillo Wells via Hwy 78</b></p><br><p>FROM: Scissors Crossing in Earthquake (Shelter) Valley<br><br></p><p>TO: Ocotillo Wells<br><br></p><p>VIA: Central Hwy 78 (paved road)</p><br><p><b>CONNECTING TRIPS</b></p><br><p>1A&#x2013;Warner Ranch Junction to Earthquake Valley via Hwy S-2<br><br></p><p>4B&#x2013;Tamarisk Grove to Ranchita (S-22) via Grapevine Canyon<br><br></p><p>4C&#x2013;Tamarisk Grove to Borrego Springs via Hwy S-3<br><br></p><p>4D&#x2013;Ocotillo Wells to Borrego Valley via San Felipe Wash<br><br></p><p>5A&#x2013;Ocotillo Wells to Trifolium (junction Hwy 86/Hwy 78) via Hwy 78<br><br></p><p>5B&#x2013;Ocotillo Wells to Fish Creek via Split Mtn Road<br><br></p><p>6A&#x2013;Earthquake Valley to Ocotillo (Imperial Co.) via Hwy S-2<br><br></p><p>6B&#x2013;Julian to Earthquake (Shelter) Valley via Hwy 78</p><br><p><b>POINTS OF INTEREST, SIDE TRIPS, AND TRAILS</b> (<i>See Appendix 4, &#x201c;Trails Found in This Book: A Quick Overview&#x201d;</i>) PCT/San Felipe Hills, Sentenac Cienega and Canyon, Grapevine Canyon, Plum Canyon, Lizard Canyon, Tamarisk Grove, Stag Cove, Mescal Bajada, Chuckwalla Wash, Mine Wash, Pinyon Wash, Nolina Wash, Bighorn Canyon, Harper Flat, Sunset Mountain, Narrows Earth Trail, Quartz Vein Wash, Old Borrego Valley Road, Nude Wash, Sunset Wash, Kane Spring Road, Borrego Springs Road/Texas Dip, Borrego Mountain, West Butte and The Slot, Hawk Canyon, Buttes Pass/Goat Trail, Harper Canyon/Cactus Garden, Blow Sand Canyon, OWSVRA Ranger Station and Discovery Center, Main Street Camp</p><br><p><b>SUMMARY</b> State post mile markers on vertical white &#x201c;paddle boards,&#x201d; emergency call boxes, and bridges appear approximately every mile.

The Vallecito Stage Station is 19 miles southeast on Hwy S-2.<br><br>Historic Hwy S-2 follows the long, narrow fault-controlled swath of Earthquake (Shelter) Valley to the southeast and San Felipe Valley to the northwest.

The PCT crosses Hwy 78 just east of Scissors Crossing. It may be seen snaking up Grapevine Mountain, en route to Barrel Spring on Hwy S-22.</p><br><p><b>PCT/Grapevine Mt/San Felipe Hills segment</b></p><br><p>You can hike a portion of the PCT northwest along the southern foot of Grapevine Mountain for a couple of miles to get a nice view of a stretch of the Elsinore fault zone in San Felipe Valley and Earthquake Valley to the southeast, which is also the route of the Butterfield Overland Stage and the Southern Emigrant Trail as it heads for Teofulio Summit to the northwest. The San Felipe Butterfield station was located below in the valley on the west side of S-2 by a spring and a large cottonwood tree and was the only wooden station on the western route (see Trip 1A).&nbsp;</p><br><p>To take this hike, park on the road near the PCT crossing. If no parking is available near the crossing, drive 0.3 mile north on S-2 to the large parking area on the east (right) for the San Felipe State Station site and monument referenced above. You can join the PCT from here by following a faint use-trail northeast up a sandy wash for a short distance. This hike has a nice variety of desert plants, especially cacti, as it is in a transition zone between low desert and high desert. The option of hiking to Barrel Spring, however, will take some planning, as it requires an overnight backpack with plenty of water. There is no water on the trail as it winds its way through the San Felipe Hills until Barrel Spring, 23.8 miles northwest. There is also no shade, and temperatures can be extreme some parts of the year. This segment of the PCT was routed down to this dry stretch of the desert because the original preferred route over Volcan Mountain crossed what was private land at the time.</p><br><p><b>End of Hike</b></p></p><h2>Raphael</h2><p><p>In art history, we tend to be on first name terms only with the most revered of masters. The Renaissance painter and architect Raphael Santi (1483&#x2013;1520) is one such star. The man we call simply Raphael has for centuries been hailed as a supreme Renaissance artist. For some, he even outstrips his equally famous, equally first-named, contemporaries, Leonardo and Michelangelo.</p><p>From 1500 to 1508, Raphael worked throughout central Italy, particularly in Florence where he secured his reputation as a painter of portraits and beautifully rendered Madonnas, archetypical icons within the Catholic faith. In 1508 he was summoned to Rome by Pope Julius II and later embarked on an ambitious mural scheme for the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. Within this room, Raphael&#x2019;s The School of Athens is considered a paradigm of the High Renaissance, merging Classical philosophy with perfected perspectival space, animated figures, and a composition of majestic balance.</p><p>This essential introduction explores how in just two decades of work, Raphael painted his way to legendary greatness. With highlights from his prolific output, it presents the mastery of figures and forms that secured his place not only in the trinity of Renaissance luminaries but also among the most esteemed artists of all time.</p></p><p>Christof Thoenes (1928-2018) studied art history in Berlin and Pavia, before completing his doctorate in Berlin. Thoenes was Honorary Professor in Hamburg and worked many years for the Bibliotheca Hertziana (Max-Planck-Institute) in Rome. He contributed to numerous publications on Italian art, particularly on architecture and architectural theory of the 15th to 18th centuries.</p><h2>To You; Love, God: A Year of Daily Guidance and Inspiration Straight from the Source</h2><p><b>Embrace God's Love Every Day</b><br><br> <i>What if God sent you a personal, daily message to remind you that he is present, that he loves you, and that things are going to work out?</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br> Will Bowen's <i>To You, Love God </i>is a collection of life-changing messages straight from the source.

In 2007, I was the minister of a church in Kansas City, Missouri. I noticed that after Sunday services people would leave upbeat and excited, ready to take on whatever life sent their way! But by the middle of the week, it was as if their spiritual batteries had drained down. Monday through Wednesdays, my office was empty, but by Thursday people would be lined up outside my door for prayer and counseling.</p> <p>I wanted people to have that tuned-in, charged-up Sunday morning feeling every day! So, one morning in prayer, I had the idea of creating an inspirational daily email as if written from God. When I got to my office, I launched a new message and typed, &#x201c;To You; Love, God.&#x201d; Then, I offered a little advice and inspiration and closed the message by reminding the reader that they are loved and that &#x201c;I&#x201d; (God) am always with them.</p> <p>Honestly, I seriously considered deleting the email because it felt outrageously egotistical to be writing for God. But then I reasoned, if it helps people feel better then that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s important. I clicked send and waited to see what would happen.</p> <p>At first, nothing did. Then, little by little, I heard people murmuring about these new emails that they were somehow receiving from &#x201c;God.&#x201d; Over time, I noticed some began to print their favorite &#x201c;God&#x201d; emails and post them at their workstations.</p> <p>One afternoon, the church secretary, whom I&#x2019;d sworn to secrecy about the authorship of the emails, buzzed my phone to tell me that one of our Board Members&#x2014;a lovable old curmudgeon in his late 80s, was in the church lobby demanding to know who wrote the daily emails from God.</p> <p>&#x201c;What should I tell him?&#x201d; She whispered nervously.</p> <p>I paused.</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell him...tell him God writes them.&#x201d; I stammered.</p> <p>I heard her relay my message. The old gentleman cleared his throat and responded in obvious frustration, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s too bad. I&#x2019;d like to have whatever book these came from&#x2014;they&#x2019;re really good. I want to give them to all my children and grandkids.&#x201d;</p> <p><em>To You; Love, God</em> is that book. It&#x2019;s a collection of the best 365 writings culled from more than 2,500 original emails spanning nearly 7 years.</p> <p><strong>Q2. What&#x2019;s your inspiration for a new writing every day?</strong></p> <p>A. Life is my inspiration. </p> <p>As I&#x2019;ve read back through the 365 writings that comprise this book, I realize that, in most cases they were responses I was seeking from God during a personal challenge. Or, they are words of encouragement, love and support directed to someone I knew who was going through a particularly difficult struggle.</p> <p>Ironically, the most frequent comment I receive from readers is, &#x201c;Thank you, this must have been written just for me!&#x201d; even though I&#x2019;ve never met the person. This shows me once again the universality of our human condition. People in the United States have many of the same concerns, fears and struggles as people in China and everywhere in between. And they all want to know that they are loved, supported and guided.</p> <p><strong>Q3. What was the response when the email recipients found out it was you ghost writing for God?</strong></p> <p>A. I kept my authorship of the daily emails secret because I didn&#x2019;t want anyone to hear my voice in their heads when they read them. These were from God and God is unique to everyone.</p> <p>It took about six years for people to figure out that I was behind God&#x2019;s daily emails. Once word got out, I began receiving calls and emails thanking me and telling me how much people came to count on the messages to help get them through their day.</p> <p>Several people shared touching stories including a woman who sat with her dying mother. She said that reading the daily emails from God was a ritual the two shared right up until the end. In her email, she quoted the To You; Love, God message she read the morning her mother passed and commented on how perfectly it both summed up her mother&#x2019;s life and comforted her as well. It was very touching and immensely gratifying.</p> <p><strong>Q4. Who can this book help the most?</strong></p> <p>A. <em>To You, Love God</em> offers support and practical guidance for people struggling with relationships, self-acceptance, happiness, health, prosperity, inner peace, and forgiveness. Anyone seeking a little guidance, inspiration, and a feeling of oneness with God and with everything will find that and more.</p>Will Bowen is an ordained minister and an internationally best-selling author of several books.

When Justin sets out on a personal odyssey to uncover the mystery of her death, what he finds could make him not only a suspect among his own colleagues, but a target for Tessa's killers as well.<br> <br> A master chronicler of the betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, John le Carrï¿½ portrays the dark side of unbridled capitalism as only he can. In <i>The Constant Gardener</i> he tells a compelling, complex story of a man elevated through tragedy, as Justin Quayle -- amateur gardener, aging widower, and ineffectual bureaucrat -- discovers his own natural resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love.</p><p>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency. <p> Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!" John le Carrï¿½ symbolically associates ThreeBees with an ominous buzz in the Nairobi morgue: "Over [the corpses], in a swaying, muddy mist, hung the flies, snoring on a single note."</p><p> The home office tries to take Quayle in out of the cold. He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carrï¿½ has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's <i>The Summer Before the Dark</i>.</p><p> But you want to know if <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is as good as <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carrï¿½ can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>John le Carrï¿½ was born in 1931. His third novel, <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>, secured him a worldwide reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy: <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i>;<i> The Honorable Schoolboy</i>; and <i>Smiley&#x2019;s People.</i> His novels include <i>The Constant Gardner</i>, <i>The Little Drummer Girl</i>, <i>A Perfect Spy</i>, <i>The Russia House</i>,<i> Our Game</i>,<i> The Tailor of Panama</i>, and <i>Single &amp; Single.</i> He lives in Cornwall, United Kingdom.</p><h2>Chester Raccoon and the Big Bad Bully (The Kissing Hand Series)</h2><p>In this latest addition to the Kissing Hand book collection, Chester Raccoon must learn to deal with another common problem of childhood: a bully at school.<br><br>When Mrs. Raccoon learns that there is a bully problem at school, she decides to investigate the situation. But after seeing the bully for herself, she shares a story about a forest that was full of smooth yellow stones, and how the animals living there changed a pointy stone they found into a smooth stone so that it wouldn't hurt any tender paws. Chester, Ronny, and Cassy follow the spirit of Mrs. Raccoon's story when they next encounter the Bully. Approaching him as a group, they invite him to play, proving that the best way to get rid of an enemy is to make him or her a friend. This book encourages children to understand that many child bullies are themselves unhappy and gives readers a good example of settling differences by peaceful means. Educators will embrace this story about a positive strategy for dealing with a bully.</p><p>Audrey Penn takes her one-woman educational program, the Writing Penn, into schools, libraries, and children&#x2019;s hospitals where she shapes and refines her story ideas in partnership with kids. She is also highly sought after as a conference keynote speaker by groups of teachers and other professionals who work with children.<br><br>An award-winning illustrator, Barbara Leonard Gibson was a freelance artist in the Baltimore-Washington area for twenty-five years. Originally from New York, and with a degree in Fine Art and Design from Carnegie Mellon University, she worked in many areas including historical illustration, children&#x2019;s books, and magazines, cartooning, portraiture, wildlife illustration, natural sciences, advertising, fantasy, and science fiction.Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;This fourth title in the series that began with <i>The Kissing Hand</i> (Tanglewood, 2007) drips with the same cloying sentimentality that characterized the others. Chester Raccoon, his younger brother, and a friend tell Mrs. Raccoon that they want to stay home from school because they are being bullied. When they describe the various nasty things the badger does, Mother Raccoon walks them to school, then leaves them there to face another day of torment. When they return and recite another litany of abuse&#x2014;"Even Owl Teacher couldn't get him to behave"&#x2014;she calls all the animals together and shares a didactic tale about a forest where the creatures treasure smooth yellow stones, but then one day happen upon a unique blue one that is sharp and pointy. Working together, they chip away at the sharp points until the blue stone is just like the yellow ones. The next day, the animals go outside for recess together, confront the bully, and then ask him to play. He "squeals in delight" at the offer. Simplistic solutions of this nature do little to assist youngsters who must deal with genuine bullies whose pattern of behavior is rarely altered by the offer of a game of catch. Gibson's illustrations, although occasionally leaning toward the precious, are bright and attractive, and the faces of the animals are quite expressive. The story will have an audience where the other books are popular, but better choices to discuss bullying abound, including Alexis O'Neill's <i>The Recess Queen</i> (Scholastic, 2002) and Trudy Ludwig's <i>My Secret Bully</i> (Tricycle, 2005).&#x2014;<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ellen Grafton perfectly matches Bianca&#39;s caustic tones as she attempts to recover from the huge blow to her self-esteem, cope with her parents&#39; messy divorce, and avoid developing a crush on the worst possible guy. In contrast, Grafton&#39;s skill falls somewhat short at creating distinguishable and fitting voices for secondary characters, including that of Wesley, Bianca&#39;s nemesis and crush. But this weakness doesn&#39;t detract from Bianca&#39;s compelling story as she attempts to choose between the boy who treats her well and the boy who makes her heart race.

Their daughter, Lorraine, hastens back from Denver to help look after him; her devotion softens the bitter absence of their estranged son, Frank, but this cannot be willed away and remains a palpable presence for all three of them. Next door, a young girl named Alice moves in with her grandmother and contends with the painful memories that Dad's condition stirs up of her own mother's death. Meanwhile, the town&#x2019;s newly arrived preacher attempts to mend his strained relationships with his wife and teenaged son, a task that proves all the more challenging when he faces the disdain of his congregation after offering more than they are accustomed to getting on a Sunday morning. And throughout, an elderly widow and her middle-aged daughter do everything they can to ease the pain of their friends and neighbors. <br><br>Despite the travails that each of these families faces, together they form bonds strong enough to carry them through the most difficult of times.&nbsp; Bracing, sad and deeply illuminating, <i>Benediction </i>captures the fullness of life by representing every stage of it, including its extinction, as well as the hopes and dreams that sustain us along the way. Here Kent Haruf gives us his most indelible portrait yet of this small town and reveals, with grace and insight, the compassion, the suffering and, above all, the humanity of its inhabitants.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, March 2013</strong>: Kent Haruf writes about small towns and regular people, but don&#x2019;t underestimate his ambition. He is writing about <em>life</em>, and to do that he has returned again and again--first with <em>Plainsong</em>, later with <em>Eventide--</em>to the small town of Holt, located on the eastern plains of Colorado. In <em>Benediction</em>, Haruf introduces us to Dad Lewis, a 77-year-old hardware store owner who has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The experience of reading Haruf is a slow burn, but as we meet the people who gather around Dad Lewis in his final days we begin to see that this is a book about community, about the things that bind us, as well as the secrets we keep to ourselves. Haruf writes with a tense, quiet realism that elevates life and death, granting both a dignity that touches on poetry. --Chris Schluep <p></p>Kent Haruf&nbsp;is the author of five previous novels (and, with the photographer Peter Brown,&nbsp;<i>West of Last Chance</i>).

In <i>Just Babies</i>, Paul Bloom argues that humans are in fact hardwired with a sense of morality. Drawing on groundbreaking research at Yale, Bloom demonstrates that, even before they can speak or walk, babies judge the goodness and badness of others&#x2019; actions; feel empathy and compassion; act to soothe those in distress; and have a rudimentary sense of justice.<br><br>Still, this innate morality is limited, sometimes tragically. We are naturally hostile to strangers, prone to parochialism and bigotry. Bringing together insights from psychology, behavioral economics, evolutionary biology, and philosophy, Bloom explores how we have come to surpass these limitations. Along the way, he examines the morality of chimpanzees, violent psychopaths, religious extremists, and Ivy League professors, and explores our often puzzling moral feelings about sex, politics, religion, and race.</p><p>In his analysis of the morality of children and adults, Bloom rejects the fashionable view that our moral decisions are driven mainly by gut feelings and unconscious biases. Just as reason has driven our great scientific discoveries, he argues, it is reason and deliberation that makes possible our moral discoveries, such as the wrongness of slavery. Ultimately, it is through our imagination, our compassion, and our uniquely human capacity for rational thought that we can transcend the primitive sense of morality we were born with, becoming more than just babies.<br><br>Paul Bloom has a gift for bringing abstract ideas to life, moving seamlessly from Darwin, Herodotus, and Adam Smith to <i>The Princess Bride</i>, Hannibal Lecter, and Louis C.K. Vivid, witty, and intellectually probing, <i>Just Babies </i>offers a radical new perspective on our moral lives.</p></p><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>A Conversation with Paul Bloom, Author of <i>Just Babies</i> </b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Q) What&#x2019;s up with the title?</strong></p> <p>A) It&#x2019;s meant to be playful, because it has two quite different meanings. <i>Just Babies</i> can express a reasonable skepticism about the abilities of these tiny creatures&#x2014;what do you expect of them, they&#x2019;re just babies? But of course &#x201c;just&#x201d; also derives from justice&#x2014;as in &#x201c;a just society&#x201d;&#x2014;and so the title captures one of the main arguments of the book, which is that we are born as moral creatures. We start off as <i>just</i> babies. I know this sounds like a remarkable claim, but I hope that my book will convince people to take it seriously. </p> <p><strong>Q) What made you choose to write this book at this moment?</strong></p> <p>A) These are exciting times for anyone interested in morality. There are major developments in areas like social neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and moral philosophy. And several research teams&#x2014;including my own at Yale&#x2014;are making surprising discoveries about the moral lives of babies and children. I think that now, perhaps for the first time in history, we have scientifically informed answers to some of the questions that matter most: How is it that we are capable of transcendent kindness&#x2014;and unspeakable cruelty? How do evolution, culture, parenting, and religion conspire to shape our moral natures? How do we make sense of people&#x2019;s strongly held opinions about abortion, gay marriage, affirmative action, and torture? And how can we become better people? <i>Just Babies</i> tries to answer these questions.</p> <p><strong>Q) How can you even study morality in babies? </strong></p> <p>A) In most of our own studies, we use puppet shows. We show babies characters who interact in certain ways&#x2014;such as one individual helping another or one individual hitting another&#x2014;and then see who the babies want to interact with, who they want to reward, and who they want to punish. Using these methods, we have discovered that even young babies have the capacity for moral judgment.</p> <p><strong>Q)So are babies naturally good, or naturally evil?</strong></p> <p>A) Both! We are born with empathy and compassion, the capacity to judge the actions of others, and a rudimentary understanding of justice and fairness. Morality is bred in the bone. But there is a nastier side to our natures as well. There&#x2019;s a lot of evidence that even the youngest babies carve the world into Us versus Them&#x2014;and they are strongly biased to favor the Us. We are very tribal beings. Our natures are not just kind; they are also cruel and selfish. We favor those who look like us and are naturally cold-blooded towards strangers.</p> <p><strong>Q) Does this mean that prejudice and racism are inevitable?</strong></p> <p>A) Happily, no. For one thing, social experience really matters&#x2014;babies and children have to learn who Us versus Them is by observing how those around them act. So while some distinctions are inevitable, such as friends versus strangers, others are not. Notably, it only pretty late in development&#x2014;by about the age of five&#x2014;that some children come to use skin color and similar cues when decide who to befriend and who to prefer. Before this, they don&#x2019;t know that race matters, and so whether or not children will be racist is dependent on how they are raised; what sort of social environments they find themselves in.</p> <p>Also, we are smart critters, smart enough to override our impulses and biases when we think they are inappropriate. Once we learn about these ugly aspects of our nature, we can move to combat them. We can create treaties and international organizations aimed at protecting universal human rights. We can employ procedures such as blind reviewing and blind auditions that are designed to prevent judges from being biased, consciously or unconsciously, by a candidate&#x2019;s race&#x2014;or anything other than what is under evaluation.</p> <p><strong>Q) It seems as if a lot of your interest is in how we come to transcend our hard-wired morality.</strong></p> <p>A) That&#x2019;s right. A complete theory of morality has to have two parts. It starts with what we are born with, and this is surprisingly rich. But a critical part of our morality&#x2014;so much of what makes us human&#x2014;is not the product of evolution, but emerges over the course of human history and individual development. It is the product of our compassion, our imagination, and our magnificent capacity for reason. We bring all that to bear when we consider such questions as: How much should we give to charity? Is it right to eat meat? Are there any sorts of consensual sex acts that are morally wrong?</p> <p><strong>Q) What do you want to accomplish with this book?</strong></p> <p>A) Two things. First, many people believe that we are born selfish and amoral&#x2014;that we start off as natural-born psychopaths. And many argue that we are, as David Hume put it, slaves of the passions: our moral judgments and moral actions are the product of neural mechanisms that we have no awareness of and no conscious control over. Intelligence and wisdom are largely impotent. This is an ugly view of human nature. Now, if it were true, we should buck up and learn to leave with it. But it&#x2019;s not true; these dismissive claims are refuted by everyday experience, by history, and by the science of developmental psychology. We are moral animals, and we are powerfully influenced by our capacity for reason.</p> <p>Second, I think there are practical implications to the scientific study of morality. If you&#x2019;re interested in reducing racism and bigotry, for instance, it is critical to understand our inborn proclivity to favor our own group over others; if you want to create a just society, you&#x2019;ll want to learn about how we naturally think about fairness and equity. Good social policy is informed by an understanding of human nature at its best and its worst, and this is what <i>Just Babies</i> is all about.</p><p><b>Paul Bloom </b>is the Brooks and Suzanne Ragen Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science at Yale University.

A mother&#x2019;s job is never done, until Sunday, that is, when she gets to take a long nap. Mama Penguin is proud of her diligent brood, and she looks forward to the day when they are as adept at penguin skills as she is. When one suggests that they might eventually be better than she is, this leaves her at a loss. What will her purpose be then? The answer is cute and heartfelt, and it will be much appreciated on Mother&#x2019;s Day. Guion&#x2019;s companion to Baby Penguins Everywhere!

Although the penguins are rendered in blacks and grays, the watercolors stand out against the copious white space (courtesy of Antarctica), in a style reminiscent of Oliver Jeffers. Because of the many baby penguins, there is lots to notice in the illustrations. A sweet book with broad appeal.

Book 1 of 3. Elizabeth Lara built a perfect life as San Francisco&#x2019;s top divorce attorney, but when she loses her great-aunt Mags, the woman who raised her, she boards a plane and leaves it all behind. The Irish shores welcome her as she learns a shocking truth, kept secret for thirty-five years. Devastated and now alone in the world, Beth tries to find peace in a beautiful cottage by Lough Rhiannon, but peace isn&#x2019;t what fate had in mind. Almost as soon as she arrives, Beth&#x2019;s solitary retreat into the magic wilds of Ireland is interrupted by Connor Bannon. A man with light brown hair, ice blue eyes and a secret of his own. He&#x2019;s gorgeous, grieving, and completely unexpected. With the help of Mags&#x2019; letters, the colorful townspeople of Dingle, and Connor, Elizabeth might just find a way back to the girl she lost long ago and become the woman she always wanted to be. A Note From Jules: Be forewarned you might not want to start this book late at night&#x2014;several readers have reported &#x201c;gobbling it up&#x201d; and going on to the next book immediately. This book is literary women&#x2019;s fiction, it is not a traditional romance, per se. It&#x2019;s a trilogy, not a standalone. All three books are vital to the story: The Irish Cottage, The London Flat, and The Paris Apartment. If I crammed Elizabeth &amp; Connor's story into one book it would be 1,000 pages long. So take a ride with me, first to Ireland and then the world. &#x201c;If you enjoy Nora Roberts, you&#x2019;ll like Juliet Gauvin. The Irish Cottage is a fresh take on women&#x2019;s literary fiction, sometimes light and scrumptious and other times quite profound in its observations on life, love and loss.&#x201d; &#x201c;A book that conveys the true feelings of Ireland when you visit...it&#x2019;s a bit of a romance, history, travel, and mystery neatly tied into a book well worth reading.&#x201d; &#x201c;I started this book and couldn't put it down. It brought me to Ireland and I never wanted to leave.&#x201d; The Irish Cottage: Finding Elizabeth is an international women&#x2019;s literary fiction romance novel with three books in the novel series. Other themes include: romance literary fiction, women&#x2019;s sagas, love stories, and second chances at life.</p><p>Juliet is originally from California. She is a true, hopeless, all-in romantic. Her first kiss was with a Frenchman in Paris, her first love was an Eagle Scout, her first crash and burn was with someone from Harvard (Jules studied history at Yale&#x2014;she should have known better). When she isn&#x2019;t writing she can be found photographing landscapes, binge watching entire series on Netflix, or dancing the international cha cha. The Irish Cottage was inspired by Jules&#x2019; love for all things Irish. A love sparked in her teens by Riverdance; fanned into a flame when she befriended a group of Irish kids in France; and blazed into a wildfire by a visit to the Emerald Isle. Earlier this year, an AncestryDNA test confirmed what Jules has suspected for a while: she&#x2019;s a third Irish (one of her grandparents continues to be unknown, but as luck would have it, the test divined that he must have been an Irish-Swede).</p><h2>On Living</h2><p><b><b>"A poetic and philosophical and brave and uplifting meditation on how important it is to make peace and meaning of our lives while we still have them.&#x201d;</b>&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2013;</i>Elizabeth Gilbert, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Eat Pray Love</i></b><br><br>"Illuminating, unflinching and ultimately inspiring... A book to treasure.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2013;People Magazine</i></b><br><b><br>A hospice chaplain passes on wisdom on giving meaning to life, from those taking leave of it. </b><br><br> As a hospice chaplain, Kerry Egan didn&#x2019;t offer sermons or prayers, unless they were requested; in fact, she found, the dying rarely want to talk about God, at least not overtly. Instead, she discovered she&#x2019;d been granted a powerful chance to witness firsthand what she calls the &#x201c;spiritual work of dying&#x201d;&#x2014;the work of finding or making meaning of one&#x2019;s life, the experiences it&#x2019;s contained and the people who have touched it, the betrayals, wounds, unfinished business, and unrealized dreams. Instead of talking, she mainly listened: to stories of hope and regret, shame and pride, mystery and revelation and secrets held too long. Most of all, though, she listened as her patients talked about love&#x2014;love for their children and partners and friends; love they didn&#x2019;t know how to offer; love they gave unconditionally; love they, sometimes belatedly, learned to grant themselves. <br><br> This isn&#x2019;t a book about dying&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a book about living. And Egan isn&#x2019;t just passively bearing witness to these stories. An emergency procedure during the birth of her first child left her physically whole but emotionally and spiritually adrift. Her work as a hospice chaplain healed her, from a brokenness she came to see we all share. Each of her patients taught her something about what matters in the end&#x2014;how to find courage in the face of fear or the strength to make amends; how to be profoundly compassionate and fiercely empathetic; how to see the world in grays instead of black and white. In this hopeful, moving, and beautiful book, she passes along all their precious and necessary gifts.</p><p><b>Kerry Egan </b>is a hospice chaplain ordained by Harvard Divinity School.

But here I am, fixin' to die, and I never did."<br><br> Gloria's milky blue eyes widened and she raised her eyebrows. She laughed, just a little bit.<br><br> "I'd have thought, with all I been through, that if anyone might could figure it all out before it was too late, it was me." She laughed again, a sort of rolling chuckle that interrupted her slow, drawling cadence. She laughed all the time.<br><br> "You know." She leaned toward me and sunlight lit up the white baby fuzz on top of her head. "I always wished I could meet a writer, and tell him my stories, so other people could hear them and not make the same mistakes I made. I'd just give him my stories. I'd say, 'Here, take them and tell them.' And you know what crazy stories I've got. But I never did. I never did meet a writer."<br><br> I was uncertain what to say. I had once written a book, more than ten years before, but I wasn't here as a writer now. Gloria was a hospice patient and I was her chaplain. I couldn't remember if I'd ever told her about my past, but I didn't think I had.<br><br> "I used to pray for it all the time, that I might could meet someone," she continued. "But I guess that prayer won't ever be answered now."<br><br> We fell silent, and I hoped Gloria would change the subject.<br><br> She lifted her hands from the armrests and let them fall as she sighed heavily. "I never even leave this house. I'm stuck here. How could I ever meet a real writer now?"<br><br> She looked at me, shook her head, and smiled.<br><br> "I prayed and prayed and prayed. Some prayers just don't get answered, I suppose." She laughed, but this time it sounded sad.<br><br> It was getting ridiculous. I hesitated for one more silent minute, then said, "Gloria, did I ever tell you I was once a writer?"<br><br> "A real writer?" Her sparse eyebrows flew up again.<br><br> "Yes, but it was a long time ago."<br><br> "Like someone who wrote a book?"<br><br> "Yes. Published and everything."<br><br> She threw up her hands and looked at the ceiling. "All this time I've been waiting for a man, Jesus!" she yelled. She bounced just slightly in her recliner. She turned and looked at me. "I thought you'd be a man, Kerry! But this is it!" She rocked back and forth and spread her arms wide. "I can feel it! This is the answer. The Holy Spirit sent you to me, and I've already told you all my stories. Now you've just got to go write them down. Maybe they could help someone. Maybe someone else can get wise from them. Promise me you'll tell my stories."<br><br> While a few patients before Gloria had told me that they wished other people could learn from their life stories-had even given me permission to share their stories with others-it was Gloria and the promise I made to her that led to this little book. I had been holding on to patientsï¿½ stories for many years by then, the stories that patients had poured out and puzzled over, the stories they turned over in their minds like the rosary beads and worn Bibles they turned over in their hands. I hoarded them, locked them away in my heart.<br><br> Often, but not always, my patients found some measure of peace as we talked. Often, but not always, their faith in something good and greater than themselves was affirmed. Often, but not always, they found strength they didn't know they had to make amends with the people in their lives, and courage to move forward without fear toward their deaths. Always, they taught me something.<br><br> We all have some experiences that we hold up as the stories that define our lives. Patients told me those stories, sometimes once or twice, and sometimes dozens of times over. Usually the way they told them changed with each telling. Not the basics of the story, but what they emphasized, the details, the connections they made between the details, and eventually, the connections they made between the various stories, even if the events they recounted happened decades apart. The meaning they found in their stories expanded and shifted.<br><br> Almost always, their stories were about shame or grief or trauma: My child died in my arms when he was four. My wife left me for another man while I was a soldier far away. I killed someone. My father raped me. I drank my life away. My husband beat my children and I did nothing to stop it because I was afraid. I was not loved, and I don't know why. The stories confused them. How could these things possibly have happened, and what did it all mean?<br><br> I donï¿½t know if listening to other peopleï¿½s life stories as they die can make you wise, but I do know that it can heal your soul. I know this because those stories healed mine.<br><br> Just as was true for every one of my patients, something had happened to me, too. What I thought of as the story that had shaped my life up to that point was one I was ashamed of. I thought I was broken and cracked and could not be put back together again, that I was destroyed at the very deepest part of me, and that this was something that could never be made better. When I started working in hospice, I didn't yet understand that everyone-everyone-is broken and cracked.<br><br> Just a few months after starting to work in hospice, I walked into the dark, run-down room of a nursing home patient whose chart said she had both colon cancer and advanced dementia. Instead of the weak, curled-up patient I expected, I found a beautiful woman with tightly set white curls on her head sitting ramrod straight on her bed. She was like an emaciated, blue-tinged china doll on the expanse of white institutional sheets.<br><br> Instead of greeting me with the deep silence of end-stage dementia, she spoke in a broad New England accent about what it was like to lose pieces of your body, pieces you had never appreciated until they were gone. It can happen, even with end-stage dementia, that a patient will have moments, or even a day, of perfect clarity. As she talked about her many years of treatment for cancer, a pink flush crept up the papery skin of her neck and across her face. First her hands and then her whole body quivered. Her voice slowly got louder as her body got tenser.<br><br> "I have no asshole!" she finally exploded. Her tiny white fists hit the bed in unison. Even using all her strength, she barely dented the sheets. "I can't shit!"<br><br> She looked away and stared at the radiator intently. When she spoke again, her voice was a gravelly whisper. "Every person who came in that hospital room, they all stared down at me. They didn't actually see me. They didn't want to see me. They talked to me in baby talk like I'm an idiot. They looked at me and thought, 'I'm happy I'm not like her.' Even if they were nice, I knew they thanked God that they weren't me. I knew they only saw a crazy, pathetic old woman who doesn't even have an asshole."<br><br> We sat in silence for a few seconds that felt like minutes. When she looked at me again, I said, "What you needed was compassion, but what you got was pity."<br><br> "Yes." She sucked in air. "Yes, that's right. That's exactly right." She looked at me with surprise. She furrowed her eyebrows and said in a different voice, an almost-accusing voice, "You're very young."<br><br> "I'm older than I look."<br><br> "No. You're young," she said flatly. "How do you know these things?"<br><br> "Well." I wasn't expecting that question. "Well, I've been through some hard things. I know what pity feels like."<br><br> She sat up even straighter and pinned me with her eyes. "Why? What's your story? What happened to you?"<br><br> I could feel heat prickle through my body. "I'd rather not say, because I'm here to talk about your life. My role as the hospice chaplain is to listen to you, to help you draw on your spiritual strengths to get through this time." I tried to sound professional.<br><br> "You're ashamed."<br><br> "No, no. Not at all." Suddenly I wanted to stand up and run. I could hear the ocean in my ears and feel my heart in my chest. I held on to the edge of the bed. "It's just that I know myself, and I know that if I start to talk about me, that's all I'll talk about, and that's not right, because I'm here to visit you and listen to you and not me. It's just not something I should talk about."<br><br> I was lying, of course. I was ashamed, and she knew it. But she was also kind enough not to call me on it.<br><br> Her brown eyes, bulging slightly from her bony eye sockets and sunken cheeks, stared into me. Then she reached for my hands and cleared her throat.<br><br> "Whatever bad things have happened to you in your life, whatever hard things you've gone through, you have to do three things: You have to accept it. You have to be kind to it," she said slowly, squeezing my fingers together. "And listen to me. You have to let it be kind to you."<br><br> I didn't understand what she meant. I didn't know how to let my hard thing be kind to me.<br><br> I had an emergency C-section with my first baby. During the surgery, the epidural anesthesia failed. I could feel everything, but the dangerous part was that I was moving while I was still cut open. The emergency anesthesia I was given is called ketamine, a drug usually used only on horses, on battlefields, and at raves. It doesn't work the way a typical anesthetic does, by shutting off the body's ability to feel pain. Instead, it works as a "dissociative anesthesia"-that is, by severing the mind-body connection so that you do not recognize pain as such. In other words, it triggers a psychotic state.<br><br> In my unlucky and unusual case, the state wasn't temporary. That drug-induced psychotic disorder lasted seven months. As a new mother I was suddenly plunged into a world of hallucinations, delusions, dissociation, suicidal ideation, and catatonia. I have almost no memories of my son's first half year of life, and I slept through the next eighteen months on a cocktail of powerful psychiatric medications. I got better, with the help of lots of therapy, drugs, and time. But I lost years of my life to that psychosis.<br><br> And I was still deeply ashamed that I had lost my mind.<br><br> I went back to see that dementia patient many times, always hoping, selfishly, to have another conversation. I wanted to learn what she'd meant, how she let the bad things that had happened be kind to her. But she never spoke a single word again. She couldn't even make or maintain eye contact. She lay in bed or in one of the huge padded vinyl recliners on wheels that nursing homes use for patients who have no control over their bodies. The dementia swallowed her back up. Only a curled-up and constricted body and a glazed silence remained.<br><br> I would sit with her and sing to her, hold her hands if they didn't look painfully clenched. I don't know if it gave her any comfort at all. A few months later she died, alone in her dark room in the middle of the night.<br><br> She likely had no memory of ever meeting me, but I've been holding on to and thinking about what she said ever since. About the wisdom to be found in stories like hers, and the kindness to be found even in our hardest things, even now, in the midst of living.<br><br> ï¿½Mommy.ï¿½ My five-year-old son sighed deeply and looked at the box of applesauce cups on the counter. He grabbed both my hands as I tried to make school lunches before work. ï¿½My have an idea.ï¿½ This was always his opening gambit. ï¿½I know you need to go to work to make people die, but I really want to go to Friendlyï¿½s today.ï¿½ He smiled and nodded. ï¿½So? Mommy? Can we go to Friendlyï¿½s? For lunch? And ice cream? A make-your-own sundae? With gummy bears and rainbow sprinkles? You love Friendlyï¿½s! Yeah?ï¿½<br><br> "Wait wait wait!" I said.<br><br> He smiled a kindergarten smile, all gums and no teeth, and kept nodding his head.<br><br> "Back up. What do you think I do at work?"<br><br> "Make people die so they can go to Heaven," he said matter-of-factly. "But you can do that tomorrow and today we can go to Friendly's? Right? You love ice cream, too. You love it more than me. More than anybody. So let's go to Friendly's. People can die tomorrow." He nodded some more.<br><br> He seemed remarkably calm that his mother was a Grim Reaper in clogs and pants that were always too snug in the waist, holding the power over life and death in the same hands that held his applesauce cup.<br><br> For the record, I don't make people die.<br><br> But I can't fault my son for not understanding what his mother did at work. Most people don't really know what chaplains do. Sometimes even other hospice workers have only a vague inkling, usually involving holding hands and saying the Hail Mary.<br><br> I've had a hard time explaining it to others myself.<br><br> "So I'm a little confused," a woman at a book club meeting once asked as we stood next to a tray of cheese and grapes. "What does a chaplain actually do?"<br><br> "We're part of the hospice team, and our role is to offer spiritual care and support to patients, families, and staff," I said, my standard response, as I piled my plate with crackers and that delicious herb-crusted goat cheese you only get to eat at parties.<br><br> "That means nothing to me," she replied. I ate a cracker. She tried again. "So tell me exactly what you did today at work."<br><br> That day, I had been at a nursing home and had visited half a dozen indigent patients with end-stage dementia and no families.<br><br> People with end-stage dementia are both the easiest and the hardest patients of all for a hospice chaplain. Like that porcelain doll patient, they sit, their tiny bodies curled and twisted in painful muscle contractions, in those huge padded recliners on wheels, with stuffed animals to comfort them. Their eyes, now enormous in sunken sockets, stare into the distance. Crusts form at the corners of their open mouths. Their skin tears like a wet tissue. They cannot speak, or walk, or feed themselves. In the last weeks or months-in a few of the saddest situations I've seen, even for long, lingering years before they finally die-they can no longer smile or hold up their heads.</p><h2>The Detective&#39;s Assistant</h2><p><b>Based on the extraordinary true story of America's first female detective, Kate Warne, this fast-paced adventure is full of feats of daring and danger, bold action, and newfound courage.<br></b><b><br></b>When orphaned eleven-year-old Nell Warne arrives in Chicago, she is shocked to find that her long-lost aunt is a <i>detective</i> working for the famous Pinkerton's National Detective agency!

Yet, in our culture, the midday meal is a forgotten opportunity to reinvigorate ourselves with food that makes us happy and energized. It has to be fairly quick and easy, and that often means resorting to convenience foods. There seems to be no middle ground: it&#x2019;s either buy lunch or pack something sad. So I&#x2019;m here to help you formulate and practice new rituals (I know some of you are already on your way!) to make homemade, balanced, and delicious lunches materialize. I&#x2019;m not suggesting that you have to cook a from-scratch, freshly prepared sit-down meal every day&#x2014;it can be just as special when prepped ahead (your new &#x201c;leftovers&#x201d;), especially with a touch more attention and creativity put into the ingredients used, presentation, and packing than what we&#x2019;re used to. I promise, the reclamation of lunch is simple!<br><br> Like most kids, I found discovering what was in my packed school lunch a thrill. My parents would send me to school with sandwiches of iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, and mayonnaise on squishy whole-wheat sandwich bread, alternating only with peanut butter and honey or peanut butter and banana (which I still really enjoy). After the main course, there was always a treat of some kind, usually a small bag of cookies or chips, and a piece of fruit. And it was all stowed away in worn (clean yet always oddly cloudy) plastic containers that circulated between my older brother, me, and finally my younger sister, until they were retired to the recycling bin when they became officially too warped to snap shut.<br><br> As my eating preferences have changed, so have my lunches. However, the midday meal continues to have a hint of delicious nostalgia for me, not simply for the food but for the community it builds. Breakfast and dinner are often family affairs, while lunch is a break in our day when most of us are connecting with friends, colleagues, or someone who happens to be enjoying their meal on the same park bench. I&#x2019;ve made friends with strangers by simply asking, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s for lunch?&#x201d;<br><br> Lunch is a meal that needs a fresh coat of paint, a meal that deserves the same respect dinner receives, while still embracing the casualness of breakfast. To me, the story of lunch as it&#x2019;s enjoyed today has yet to be told. Yes, it&#x2019;s a break in the day to replenish the body and mind, even if you&#x2019;re devouring a cup of noodles &#x201c;al desko,&#x201d; an Oxford English Dictionary-defined word (you&#x2019;re welcome!). It&#x2019;s a way to travel and taste a range of global flavors, all without a plane ticket. A homemade lunch saves you money, helps you eat healthier (made easier still with the recipes in this book), and gives you a swift boost to reenergize your day. And it&#x2019;s a meal where the lighting is just so perfect for capturing a photo to share on Instagram (I do, @allisondaycooks). But it can be more than this, too. I&#x2019;d like to introduce you to the &#x201c;modern lunch.&#x201d; <br><br> A modern lunch is special, simple, (mostly) make-ahead, healthy, share-worthy, community building, money saving, colorful, and delicious. It culls inspiration from world cuisines, is adaptable to your personal taste and pantry, and is always satisfying. It can be enjoyed at your desk, in the lunchroom, on a bench outside, at home, on the road, on a picnic blanket, in the car, at a set table, or on your lap in front of the TV. A modern lunch can be about connectedness: it&#x2019;s a time to put yourself out there, socialize, and make new friends or bond with old ones. Done with intention and meaning, the modern lunch should get you excited about a quality midday meal!</p><h2>Peaceful Fights for Equal Rights</h2><p><b>A primer for peaceful protest, resistance, and activism from the author of <i>Rodzilla </i>and <i>Pride: The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag</i>. </b><br><br>Protesting.

Originally from Brooklyn, New York, he currently resides with his wife and children in Scottsdale, Arizona.In the 15 years since becoming a grandparent, and in the years before when our children were small never have I seen children so eager to participate in the reading of the Hagaddah. As a child, I suffered through hours of prayers, tedious rhetoric and information that I didn't understand. Last night, our grandson who is about to be bar mitzvah, led the [30 minute] Seder. You can't imagine how wonderful it was to see our grandchildren happily engaged in a ritual I dreaded. He is going to do it again this evening, and we will be as proud tonight as we were last night. But best of all he was so pleased with himself. Thank you for making hours of torture into a pleasant experience for all. Please feel free to use this email as a testimonial. --Gail B.<br><br>Just Perfect - All I can say is that this 30 minute Seder Haggadah is just perfect. It's simple, easy to understand and great for busy homes. This is the second time we used the haggadah and allowed us to enjoy the whole experience. Doesn't skimp on the important parts, provides good explanation and allows everyone to participate. I recommend it whole heartedly and I think it's perfect for families with small children who need to move through the telling fast. --Amazon.com<br><br>Keep the tradition alive, but in a simplified fashion - My father always led the family Seder. He used an old-school Haggadah (very lengthly), but when the tradition of leading the Seder was passed along to the next generation (my brother and I), we found the old Haggadah too involved. Unlike our father, who knew exactly where to go in the old Haggadah to cover the key parts of the Seder, we spent way to much time searching for what we wanted (and unfortunately, missing much of what we wanted, too). After this experience, I went on-line looking for a simpler Haggadah. I found this one, with a number of good reviews. I ordered one copy, and after looking through it, I have now ordered 15 more. The Haggadah covers the key parts of the Seder, with an emphasis on explanations of the symbolism and meaning of the the things covered in the Seder. For our family, not well-versed in the intricacies of our religion, but certainly wanting to keep this tradition alive, this Haggadah is just right. --Amazon.com<br><br>Excellent - We usually attend someone else's Passover, but last year the plan changed and I was thrust into the role of Leader of the Seder. We are not a very religious group (some of us are not even Jewish) so we were seeking an experience that would be respectful of tradition and the meaning of Passover while not giving us more detail than we wanted. We did not want some sort of new-age "Passover for Dummies" where the significance and essence of the holiday and its history are dumbed down or lost. We found that this "30 Minute Seder" Haggadah provided exactly the right balance for us. --Amazon.com</p><h2>Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook: Airframe, Volume 1 (2023): FAA-H-8083-31A (ASA FAA Handbook Series)</h2><p>The FAA Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbooks are designed for use by instructors and applicants preparing for the FAA Knowledge Exam and Oral &amp; Practical (O&amp;P) Exams required for obtaining an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) certificate with Airframe or Powerplant rating or both (also called an A&amp;P license).

As they part, Seth slips Jack a key, along with a perplexing message. The next day Jack is summoned to an apartment where two men claim Seth has disappeared with funds for a vital intelligence operation. They say he&#x2019;s turned and leave Jack with a warning: <i>&nbsp;If you hear from Seth, call us. Do not get involved. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Jack soon finds himself lost in a maze of intrigue, lies, and betrayal where no one is who they seem to be&#x2014;not even Seth, who&#x2019;s harboring a secret that harkens back to the Cold War. A secret that is driving him to the brink of treason....</p><p>A little more than thirty years ago <b>Tom Clancy </b>was a Maryland insurance broker with a passion for naval history. Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore&#x2019;s Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>&#x2014;the first of the phenomenally successful Jack Ryan novels&#x2014;sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it &#x201c;the perfect yarn.&#x201d; From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.<br><br><b>Grant Blackwood</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Briggs Tanner series (<i>End of Enemies</i>, <i>Wall of Night</i>, and <i>Echo of War</i>). He is coauthor of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Dead or Alive</i>, with Tom Clancy, and of the thriller <i>The Kill Switch</i>, with James Rollins. A U.S. Navy veteran, Grant spent three years aboard a guided missile frigate as an Operations Specialist and a Pilot Rescue Swimmer. He lives in Arizona, where he is working on his own stand-alone series starring a new hero.<p></p><p>Tehran, Iran</p><p>BE CAREFUL how you spend your time. You never get it back.</p><p>Of all the lessons he&#x2019;d learned from his father, this one truly resonated with Jack Ryan, Jr.&#x2014;no small feat, as he&#x2019;d received the advice as a teenager with little more on his mind than girls and football games. <i>Go figure,</i> Jack thought.</p><p>In this case, with his lunch appointment predictably late, Jack was playing a round of &#x201c;watch the watchers,&#x201d; a game introduced to him by John Clark. His location, Chaibar, an outdoor cafï¿½ on a quiet Tehran side street, made the game more challenging. Nestled in the courtyard garden of a renovated villa, Chaibar was full of couples and small groups seated at wrought-iron tables. Jack caught glimpses of muted flowered murals behind potted plants and hanging vines. Overhead, boughs cast the courtyard in dappled sunlight. While most of the murmured voices were speaking in Arabic or Persian, Jack also caught snippets of French and Italian.</p><p>The premise of &#x201c;watch the watchers&#x201d; was a simple one: He&#x2019;s in the field for Hendley Associates, aka The Campus. He&#x2019;s under surveillance. But by whom? If you&#x2019;re largely unfamiliar with the nuances of casual Iranian interaction, how do you spot that one pair of eyes paying too much attention to you, or someone whose mannerisms are out of sync with the surroundings? With this checklist in mind, Jack studied faces, body language, banter between this couple, or forced banter among that group.</p><p><i>Nothing,</i> Jack thought. None of Chaibar&#x2019;s patrons set off alarms for him. In real life, a good thing; for the purposes of this game, not so much.</p><p>If Hendley Associates, aka The Campus, were in fact what it seemed, a privately held arbitrage firm, Jack&#x2019;s game would have been one of fantasy, but The Campus&#x2019;s true purpose went much deeper, as it sat squarely in the grayest of areas in the espionage/counterterrorism world&#x2014;an off-the-books intelligence group answerable only to the President of the United States. Where the CIA was a bazooka, The Campus was a stiletto.</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon, sir. Another coffee, please?&#x201d;</p><p>Jack glanced up. His waitress was a petite twentysomething woman in black-rimmed glasses, her hair completely covered by a light blue scarf. Her English was heavily stilted.</p><p>She wore no niqab. Perhaps Kamran Farahani wasn&#x2019;t simply giving lip service to his administration&#x2019;s moderate platform. Hell, even a year ago Chaibar might have been subject to a police raid; to the previous government, coffee shops were incubators for youthful subversives.</p><p>Jack glanced down at his empty cup. The shop&#x2019;s version of coffee made a Starbucks dark roast seem like weak tea.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thank you, two is enough for me. Hopefully my guest will&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>As if on cue, over his waitress&#x2019;s shoulder, Jack saw a man with wild, curly black hair walking into the courtyard, his head turning this way and that. There was no mistaking that mop.</p><p>&#x201c;Here he is,&#x201d; Jack told her, raising his hand to get the man&#x2019;s attention. &#x201c;Give us a couple minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>The man walked over to the table. Jack stood up, the iron legs of his chair scraping on the cobblestones. They shook hands, shared a quick bear hug, then sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late, Jack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m used to it. What would a lunch be with an on-time Seth Gregory?&#x201d;</p><p>It had been that way since high school. If the movie started at seven-twenty, you told Seth seven o&#x2019;clock.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah. It&#x2019;s my only failing. And if you believe that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How&#x2019;s the coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It bent my spoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Puts hair on your chest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;ve you been, Seth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharp stick, my friend, sharp stick.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack smiled. This was Seth&#x2019;s standard response to such questions. Translation: Doing better than if I had a sharp stick in the eye.</p><p>&#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been here before; I know what I want. The <i>asheh gojeh farangi</i>&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a tomato stew with onions, meat, peas, spices. Delicious. Huh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still no alcohol on the menu, I see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That might take longer. Farahani can&#x2019;t shock the old guard too much, too quickly.&#x201d;</p><p>The waitress returned. They both ordered the stew. &#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll share a basket of barbari bread,&#x201d; Seth added. The waitress collected their menus and disappeared.</p><p>With elbows on the table, Seth reached across and gave Jack&#x2019;s hand a couple of gentle slaps. &#x201c;Jack, you look good! I&#x2019;ve missed you. How ya doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was surprised to get your call.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking we&#x2019;d have lunch the next time you were in the States. I had no idea you were in the area.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth shrugged, waved his hand. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the family? Olivia? And El Presidente&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Il Duce?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine, all fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack had to smile, and not just because Seth was one of the few people who called Sally by her given name and refused to call Jack&#x2019;s father by his correct title, but because this exuberant and near-frenetic questioning was pure Seth Gregory. His friend not only was the quintessential people person, but also suffered from ADHD&#x2014;emphasis on the &#x201c;hyperactivity disorder&#x201d; part. Seth had struggled in school. Jack had been his unofficial tutor.</p><p>Jack had always sensed an undercurrent of sadness behind Seth&#x2019;s gregariousness. Despite having known the man since St. Matthew&#x2019;s Academy, Jack always felt there was a part of Seth he kept hidden not only from the world, but from Jack as well. Jack had few friends at St. Matthew&#x2019;s, as most of his classmates had either shunned him as the stuck-up Golden Child of then CIA bigwig Jack Ryan or had been intimidated by the ostensibly lofty circles in which &#x201c;Spy Boy&#x201d; orbited. Of course, neither scenario had been true, and Jack had spent his first year at St. Matthew&#x2019;s trying to prove so, to no avail. But Seth had accepted Jack for who he was&#x2014;an awkward teenager just trying to find his way like everyone else. Looking back at that time, Jack knew Seth had saved him from withdrawing into himself and spiraling into self-isolation. Seth didn&#x2019;t give a shit who Jack&#x2019;s father was, or where he lived, or that he rubbed shoulders with foreign royalty and heads of state at grand dinner parties. In fact, invariably, Seth&#x2019;s only question about such affairs had been whether there&#x2019;d been any hot girls at the event and whether Jack had hooked up with any of them in some ï¿½ber-secret room at Langley.</p><p>Jack had always regretted not telling Seth how much his friendship had meant to him. Perhaps now was the time. Before Jack could do this, Seth continued his rapid-fire interrogation. Sometimes having a conversation with him was like being in the middle of a verbal tornado.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on with Olivia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sally?&#x201d; Jack replied. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t heard? She&#x2019;s an astronaut.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? Oh, that&#x2019;s very funny, Jack. You&#x2019;re quite the commode-ian.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack laughed. &#x201c;Man, you&#x2019;re still saying that? It wasn&#x2019;t even funny when we were fifteen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it was funny, and you know it. So: Sally?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She just finished with her residency at Johns Hopkins.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Underachiever, that one. Are you still at that place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that financial group?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hendley Associates.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Making tons of money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doing okay,&#x201d; Jack replied. The true answer was yes. Though the investment side of Hendley Associates was merely a cover for The Campus, Jack and his cohorts had in fact made hundreds of millions playing the world&#x2019;s markets. Of that revenue, only a fraction paid their salaries. The rest funded the off-the-books intelligence organization.</p><p>Seth said, &#x201c;And how about&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Jack laughed and raised his hands in mock surrender. &#x201c;Enough, Seth. You&#x2019;re wearing me out. Tell me about you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still consulting. Been on contract with Shell for the last eighteen months. I was based out of Baku until about eight months ago, when they moved me here.&#x201d;</p><p>After high school Seth had snagged a Gus Archie Memorial Scholarship to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&#x2019;s College of Engineering. Now, apparently, he was parlaying that into big bucks.</p><p>&#x201c;I like it in Tehran, actually. My condo&#x2019;s within walking distance of here. Great place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your specialty?&#x201d; asked Jack.</p><p>&#x201c;Mostly looking at drilling rigs and refining plants. It&#x2019;s a nice gig. I spend most of my time in Central Asia.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dicey areas.&#x201d; <i>Especially the two &#x201c;stans&#x201d; from which the Emir, aka Saif Rahman Yasin, sprang,</i> Jack thought. Helping to nab that son of a bitch had been not only damned satisfying, but also Jack&#x2019;s first foray into the world of field operations.</p><p>Seth said, &#x201c;We get good training and plenty of security when we need it&#x2014;Blackwater-type guys, mostly retirees from U.S. Special Forces. Nice guys. I&#x2019;d hate to get on their bad side, though.&#x201d;</p><p>A sentiment most bad guys share after receiving a visit from Navy SEALs or Army Delta Force, Jack thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Got any investment advice for me?&#x201d; Jack said.</p><p>&#x201c;No. And you wouldn&#x2019;t listen if I did,&#x201d; replied Seth. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a straight arrow, Jack, and you know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack shrugged. &#x201c;True enough. Plus, I&#x2019;ve got a healthy fear of the SEC.&#x201d;</p><p>Their food came and they ate. Jack followed Seth&#x2019;s lead, tearing chunks off the barbari bread and mixing it into the tomato stew. It was delicious and filling.</p><p>&#x201c;I was sorry to hear about your dad,&#x201d; Jack said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. I got your card, thanks. Sorry I didn&#x2019;t say anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your mom doing with it all?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been three years. Looking at her, you&#x2019;d think he died last week.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s understandable.&#x201d; Seth&#x2019;s father, Paul, had died of a sudden stroke. Seth&#x2019;s mother had found him in the study. She&#x2019;d never fully recovered.</p><p>&#x201c;Man, I don&#x2019;t know what to do for her,&#x201d; said Seth. &#x201c;My sister, Bethany&#x2014;you remember Bethany, right?&#x2014;lives about an hour north of her in Georgia. She took her to the doctor, who gave her some kind of prescription&#x2014;Lamictal, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mood stabilizer and antidepressant,&#x201d; Jack said. Half expecting Seth to have jumped to another subject, Jack was surprised he was being forthcoming with such intimate details. &#x201c;How long has she been on it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A couple weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s going to start helping, it&#x2019;ll be any time now.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth smiled. &#x201c;The benefits of having two doctors in the family, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep. Osmotic knowledge, I suppose.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth dipped a chunk of bread into his stew, then popped it into his mouth. &#x201c;So, what brings you to Tehran?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Scouting. Iranian markets are starting to open up. If Farahani keeps his course, there&#x2019;s going to be a boom. Hendley needs to be ready.&#x201d;</p><p>While this was true and was certainly part of the reason for Jack&#x2019;s presence in the country, this was primarily an intelligence-gathering junket. While poring over the new media outlets blossoming in Iran was informative, there was no substitute for what John Clark, Hendley&#x2019;s new operations chief, called a Mark I Eyeball inspection. It was a Navy term, Clark had explained. &#x201c;Walk the streets and talk to people. Best tool in a spook&#x2019;s arsenal.&#x201d; So far Jack had neither seen nor heard anything to suggest Iran&#x2019;s new president was anything but what he seemed&#x2014;the first true moderate to hold office since the 1979 revolution. Whether he&#x2019;d last was anyone&#x2019;s guess.</p><p>Jack put that question to Seth: &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been here awhile. What&#x2019;s your take on all this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hell, Jack, I don&#x2019;t know. I came here for the first time after the election. I can tell you this much: Nobody&#x2019;s been anything but polite to me. I get dirty looks occasionally from some of the graybeards but that&#x2019;s about it. No one&#x2019;s ever called me &#x2018;imperialist Satan,&#x2019; if that tells you anything.&#x201d;</p><p><i>It does,</i> Jack thought. Before Farahani took office, Seth would have had minders on his tail every moment he was outside his apartment. That would&#x2019;ve been the best-case scenario. And with no reports of SAVAK-style crackdowns on the population, the fact that Seth&#x2014;an American, of all things&#x2014;could walk the streets unmolested suggested most of Iran&#x2019;s citizenry was on board with Farahani&#x2019;s reforms.</p><p><i>Ceaseless miracles,</i> Jack thought.</p><p>They chatted for another hour and shared half a dozen cups of mint tea from a silver samovar the size of a small terrier until finally Seth glanced at his watch. &#x201c;Shoot. I gotta go, Jack, sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth stood up. Jack did the same and extended his hand. Seth grasped it and then did something he rarely did: He held Jack&#x2019;s gaze. &#x201c;Really good to see you, man. I mean it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You too, Seth.&#x201d; Jack hesitated. &#x201c;Everything okay with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, why wouldn&#x2019;t it be? Hey, listen, my apartment&#x2019;s about fifteen minutes from here.&#x201d; Seth gave him the address. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s right off Niavaran Park. If you&#x2019;re ever back in town and need a place to crash, it&#x2019;s yours. Just use the key. There&#x2019;re steaks in the freezer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, man, that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Travel safe, Jack.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth turned and walked away, disappearing through a vine-wrapped arch.</p><p><i>Key&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what key?</i> Jack thought. He sat back down and reached for his teacup. Sitting beside it was a bronze key.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell was all that about?&#x201d; he muttered to himself.</p><p>Edinburgh, Scotland</p><p>As the only member of her team to have spent time in the United Kingdom prior to the start of the job, Helen was unsurprised by the blitz of blinking lights and cacophony of voices filtering through the van&#x2019;s half-open windows.</p><p>Yegor braked hard and the van lurched to a stop as a young man and woman, clearly inebriated, stumbled past the front bumper. The woman raised two fingers at Yegor and called, &#x201c;Tosser!&#x201d;</p><p>Helen saw Yegor&#x2019;s jaw pulse with anger, but he did not respond, and instead waited for them to pass before easing the van forward. On either side of the street, similarly intoxicated youth staggered and weaved along the sidewalks. On the passenger side, outside Helen&#x2019;s half-open window, a pub&#x2019;s door burst open, issuing a stream of drunks and pulsing dance music.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s a tosser?&#x201d; asked Yegor.</p><p><i>Someone who desperately needs a girlfriend,</i> Helen thought with a smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain later,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;This is amazing. What are all these places?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pubs,&#x201d; Helen answered.</p><p>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pretty much. This is just one area. This is Rose,&#x201d; Helen said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the most popular pub street for students.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All of these people are students from the university?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do they function in the morning?&#x201d; asked Yegor. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t they have lectures to attend?&#x201d;</p><p>Helen smiled at this. Ever the pragmatist, Yegor wasn&#x2019;t so concerned about the immorality he was seeing but rather how it affected the revelers&#x2019; study habits.</p><p>&#x201c;Coffee,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;And other things, I suspect.&#x201d;</p><p>In the backseat, the other two members of the team, Roma and Olik, sat with their foreheads nearly pressed against the rear windows, their eyes agog. Where they came from, public displays like these were punishable by imprisonment. Or worse.</p><p>Of course, Helen reminded herself, Roma and Olik were men, and sheltered ones at that. Most of their astonishment probably stemmed from the sea of exposed female skin passing before their eyes. Not to mention the physical intimacy couples showed each other on the street. <i>Snogging</i> was the term here.

Meanwhile, 12-year-old Chap Brayburn, the cafe proprietor&#x2019;s son, is worried about rich, horrible Sonny Boy Beaucoup, who wants to turn the swamp into the &#x201c;Gator World Wrestling Arena and Theme Park.&#x201d; The swamp&#x2019;s salvation may lie with the furry, bearlike Sugar Man, whose &#x201c;hands were as large as palmetto ferns&#x201d; and &#x201c;feet were like small boats,&#x201d; but finding and awakening him is no easy task. The book&#x2019;s folksy narrative adds brightness and humor to the story as Appelt explores the swamp&#x2019;s rich history, varied denizens, and current threats. Heroes and villains are drawn in bold strokes, but while there&#x2019;s little doubt who will emerge victorious, finding out how events unfurl is well worth the read." (<i>Publishers Weekly, STARRED REVIEW</i>)<br><br><b>* </b>&#x201c;Appelt returns with a rich tale set deep in a Texas swamp, full of critters including gators, rattlesnakes, and feral hogs. Brothers Bingo and J&#x2019;miah are true-blue scouts (raccoons) who have set up house in an abandoned old DeSoto, adorning it with their artwork and following orders from the Voice of Intelligence (actually the lightning-enabled car radio). The young raccoons are affable and easy to root for as they attempt to stop the gang of wild hogs intent on destroying their beloved Muscovado sugar cane.... Appelt has adeptly intertwined the folksy narrative of a tall tale with a perfect blend of adventure and mystery, all the while subtly bringing an ecological message to the surface.&#x201d; (<i>Library School Journal, STARRED REVIEW</i>)<br><br>*"As with her Newbery Honor book <i>The Underneath</i>, Kathi Appelt sets this captivating web of interconnected stories in the ancient forests of piney trees and integrates the alluring lore of the bayou. But she adopts a lighter voice, just right for a storyteller with a Southern drawl to read aloud.<br> <br> Deep in the Sugar Man Swamp, raccoons Bingo and J'miah serve as Information Officers from the safety of a 1949 DeSoto. Whenever lightning strikes nearby, it triggers "the Voice of Intelligence" (children will quickly realize it's a radio) that often gives them orders. Chap, the 12-year-old grandson of Audie Brayburn, makes it his mission to find his grandfather's DeSoto and complete his quest of locating the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. Ever since Audie's recent death, Sonny Boy Beaucoup, "the official owner" of the swamp, has threatened to run Chap and his mother out of their Paradise Pies Cafï¿½, so that he can set up a theme park. The local radio announcer's daily sign-off bids "all you swamp critters to have a good day and a good idea," and each character gets at least one.<br> <br> Appelt weaves the rich language of legends passed down through generations. The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is as mythical as the Sugar Man. She carries weighty themes lightly, and spins a story that reminds us that kin extends beyond the prescribed family tree. By the end of the story, we understand that that includes "all the swamp critter." As Audie told Chap, they are <i>paisanos</i>, fellow countrymen. They come from the same soil. --Jennifer M.

Having spent their lives in service to a church that seems to no longer serve them, they are confused about their own futures and the future of the entire monastery. Led by Mike, the practical no-nonsense prioress, and Augusta, the grand ancient mystic hermit, they are joined by Gemma, a self-punishing novice, and Arielle, a firebrand jailhouse conversion who was sent there out of rehab by a &#x201c;sort of angel.&#x201d; The personalities, commitments, philosophies and beliefs of these and all the characters conflict and converge in ways at once perilous and enlightening.

Though they are super-powered beings, and though their foes are bent on world domination, all that is conventional ends there. Shunned as freaks and outcasts, and tempered by loss and insanity, this band of misfits faces threats so mystifying in nature and so corrupted in motive that reality itself threatens to fall apart around them &#x2014; but it&#x2019;s still all in a day&#x2019;s work for the Doom Patrol.<br> &nbsp;<br> Written by Grant Morrison and featuring art by Richard Case, Mark McKenna, Kelley Jones, Mike Dringenberg and Steve Yeowell, DOOM PATROL BOOK TWO collects issues #35-50 of the groundbreaking series and includes a foreword and special sketchbook section from Morrison.</p><p>Grant Morrison has been working with DC Comics for more than twenty years, beginning with his legendary runs on the revolutionary titles ANIMAL MAN and DOOM PATROL. Since then he has written numerous bestsellers &#x2014; including THE MULTIVERSITY, JLA, BATMAN and <i>New X-Men</i> &#x2014; as well as the critically acclaimed creator-owned series THE INVISIBLES, SEAGUY, THE FILTH, WE3 and JOE THE BARBARIAN. Morrison has also expanded the borders of the DC Universe in the award-winning pages of SEVEN SOLDIERS, ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, FINAL CRISIS, BATMAN, INC. and ACTION COMICS.<br><br> In his secret identity, Morrison is a &#x201c;counterculture&#x201d; spokesperson, a musician, an award-winning playwright and a chaos magician. He is also the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Supergods</i>, a groundbreaking psycho-historic mapping of the superhero as a cultural organism. He divides his time between his homes in Los Angeles and Scotland.Before writing such critically acclaimed cult comics as <i>The Invisibles</i>, Morrison made his name in 1988 by updating Animal Man, a third-rate 1960s costumed crimefighter. The next year he similarly resuscitated the Doom Patrol, a band of misfit superheroes whose strange powers made society fear and hate them (compare Marvel's X-Men, who debuted at the same time). Morrison's <i>Animal Man</i> drew praise for daring experimentation, but his "World's Strangest Superheroes" raised the stakes by replacing many original cast members with the likes of Crazy Jane, a schizophrenic whose multiple personalities each has its own superpower, and Dorothy Spinner, an ape-faced girl with the ability to distort reality. In this second collection of Morrison's <i>Doom Patrol</i> run, the archvillainous Brotherhood of Evil has been supplanted by the ludicrous but dangerous Brotherhood of Dada. Morrison's outrageously inventive takes on superheroes, which manage to be both smart and silly, may be off-putting to tradition-minded fans. The compensation is that his sensibility draws readers who usually prefer alternative comics. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

This expansive theological work provided an articulate defense of Christianity against the claims that it lead to the downfall of Rome in the years preceding its publication. It outlines a citizenship that goes beyond the worldly, the political, and the self-centered, instead focusing on a place where the inhabitants are devout, God-focused, and seeking grace. In examining history with a clear perception of good and evil, Augustine was in effect interpreting human actions in relation to eternity. He contrasts earthly and heavenly cities to great effect, in addition to inspecting pagan religions, Greek philosophers like Plato, and the Bible. A monumental influence upon Augustine&#x2019;s contemporaries, &#x201c;The City of God&#x201d; is considered a foundational work of Christianity philosophy, which would establish Augustine of Hippo as one of the most important fathers of the Catholic Church, and continues to resonate with the Christian faith until this day.

Sheen encourage readers to explore the essence and promise of the season. Those looking to grow in their prayer life and become more attuned to the joy of Advent and Christmas will find a wonderful guide in this spiritual companion.</p><p>Bishop Sheen's 28 brief Advent meditations reflect on the Incarnation, birth and earthly ministry of Christ. Because most are only a paragraph long, they are a bit too general and lack the anecdotal specificity that drove many of Sheen's most famous sermons home. Still, the meditations on the "Divine Sense of Humor" and Jesus as "a rich person who became a poor man" are vintage Sheen, powerful in their very simplicity. The four weeks of Advent meditations are followed by reflections for the 12 days from Christmas to Epiphany. The book's final section offers a liturgy to adapt the reflections for group or individual prayer, complete with responsive readings, Psalms and hymns. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Bad Kitty: Kitten Trouble (classic black-and-white edition)</h2><p><p>There's terrible news in the neighborhood next to Kitty's! </p><p>A conflict there is growing worse and worse.

Follow the visionaries behind the plan as it springs to green life.</b><br><br>In 1858, New York City was growing so fast that new roads and tall buildings threatened to swallow up the remaining open space. The people needed a green place to be &#x2014; a park with ponds to row on and paths for wandering through trees and over bridges. When a citywide contest solicited plans for creating a park out of barren swampland, Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted put their heads together to create the winning design, and the hard work of making their plans a reality began. By winter, the lake opened for skating. By the next summer, the waterside woodland known as the Ramble opened for all to enjoy. Meanwhile, sculptors, stone masons, and master gardeners joined in to construct thirty-four unique bridges, along with fountains, pagodas, and band shells, making New York's Central Park a green gift to everyone. Included in the end matter are bios of Vaux and Olmsted, a bibliography, and engaging factual snippets.</p><p><b>Ashley Benham Yazdani </b>holds an MFA from the Illustration Practice Program at the Maryland Institute College of Art and a BFA in illustration from California College of the Arts. <i>A Green Place to Be</i> is her debut picture book.This delightful slice of history shows the hard work and careful planning that went into one of the world&#x2019;s great outdoor public spaces, New York City&#x2019;s &#x2018;vibrant jewel.&#x2019; Yazdani&#x2019;s mesmerizing watercolor and pencil art teems with fascinating details as it makes the park&#x2019;s past and present seem unified, driving home the importance of creating and preserving &#x2018;quiet green spots in a fast-changing world.&#x2019;<br>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review<br><br>New Yorkers are still enjoying their very special place to walk, play ball, sail model boats, attend concerts, and so much more.

The author takes you through each period step by step, explaining the major covenants and highlighting the most important people, events, and biblical themes.

Although many assume that what Muslim faith they brought with them to the Americas was quickly absorbed into the new Christian milieu, as Sylviane A. Diouf demonstrates in this meticulously-researched, groundbreaking volume, Islam flourished during slavery on a large scale. She details how, even while enslaved, many Muslims managed to follow most of the precepts of their religion. Literate, urban, and well-traveled, they drew on their organization, solidarity and the strength of their beliefs to play a major part in the most well-known slave uprisings. But for all their accomplishments and contributions to the history and cultures of the African Diaspora, the Muslims have been largely ignored. &nbsp;<em>Servants of Allah</em>&#x2014;a Choice 1999 Outstanding Academic Title&#x2014;illuminates the role of Islam in the lives of both individual practitioners and communities, and shows that though the religion did not survive in the Americas in its orthodox form, its mark can be found in certain religions, traditions, and artistic creations of people of African descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;This 15th anniversary edition has been updated to include new materials and analysis, a review of developments in the field, prospects for new research, and new illustrations.</p><p>Faith and spirituality have always been powerful forces in the histories of people of African descent. Central to that history is Islam. Servants of Allah documents the significance of Islam in the development of black societies in the Americas. The connection between West Africa and the Americas was grounded in a religious and cultural continuity that many scholars have previously ignored. Servants of Allah makes an important contribution to a critically important dimension of black scholarship. Manning Marable, Director, Institute for Research in African-American Studies, Columbia University. <p>A welcome and timely work on a subject of great importance. By combining materials in African Islam with New World sources and thereby linking both sides of the Atlantic, the author provides a fresh angle on studies of the Diaspora. Readers will find in the book a great deal of information presented in a clear, lively style. Lamin Sanneh, D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity, and Professor of History, Yale University. </p><p>An excellent work on African Muslim slaves in the New World. Diouf has demonstrated what vigorous scholarship and creative imagination can do to reconstruct the lives and times of these men and women of Africa. Sulayman Nyang, Professor of African Studies, Howard University. </p><p>An accessible, lucid account of an important and complicated aspect of African enslavement in the Americas, and a provocative and effective reading of the interaction of African Muslims with the American slave institution.

Nobody could have expected what would happen when the story continued. Collected here is the entire trilogy of Chuck Tingle&#x2019;s history making Space Raptor Butt series. SPACE RAPTOR BUTT INVASION Space can be a lonely place, especially when you&#x2019;re stationed by yourself on the distant planet Zorbus. In fact, Lance isn&#x2019;t quite sure that can last the whole year before his shuttle pod arrives, but when a mysterious visitor appears at Lance&#x2019;s terraforming station, he quickly realizes that he might not be so alone after all. Soon enough, Lance becomes close with this mysterious new astronaut, a velociraptor. Together, they form an unlikely duo, which quickly begins to cross the boundaries of friendship into something much, much more sensual. It&#x2019;s not gay if it&#x2019;s a man and a dinosaur, is it? SPACE RAPTOR BUTT REDEMPTION After a year stationed on planet Zorbus, astronaut Lance Tanner and his raptor lover Orion return home to find that they are not greeted as heroes, but as villains. Unbeknownst to Lance, his space travels have been funded by the villainous Scoundrels Inc, a corporation that has deep ties to the illegal trade of unicorn tears and a destructive mining project at the core of the earth. Now Lance is on trial for a number of false charges; from having connections to the wicked Scoundrels, to being too strange for space. The opposing lawyer argues that space is only for serious astronauts, and that love between a raptor and a man is giving space travel a bad name. Lance is arguing that there&#x2019;s room to be weird in space. More importantly, Lance is arguing for the idea of love itself; that just because something comes out of darkness doesn&#x2019;t mean it can&#x2019;t become a beacon of light. Of course, this all culminates in a hardcore dinosaur on astronaut pounding that will have your jaw on the courtroom floor! SPACE RAPTOR BUTT ASCENSION Soon after blasting off on their mission to find refuge for the people of Earth 1 on the dinosaur inhabited Earth 2, Orion and his space raptor lover Lance find a spaceship stow away, the notorious CEO of Scounrels Inc, Vam Dox. Vam claims that his intentions are pure, but it&#x2019;s hard to trust such a sad, strange man. After landing in Hugona, the planet capital of Earth 2, our heroes restrain Vam Dox and head off to secure an important diplomatic relationship with the pterodactyl president, but that&#x2019;s when all hell breaks loose. Soon, Vam Dox is storming the capital with a band of rabid dogs, and Lance and Orion are wrongly taking the blame! Fortunately, Lance and Orion know that the only cure for evil this strong is to prove their love in a hardcore gay encounter at the steps of the capital building. When the smoke clears, will Vam Dox be revealed as the super villain that he claims to be, or a meek, lonesome manbaby who is starved for attention?</p><p></p><h2>Birding Is My Favorite Video Game: Cartoons about the Natural World from Bird and Moon</h2><p>Amusing science cartoons about the natural world including animal dating profiles, wildlife wine pairings, threat displays of completely non-threatening animals, why hammerhead sharks have hammer heads, and much more.<br>&nbsp;<br><br><i>Birding is My Favorite Video Game</i> is a collection of fun, quasi-educational comics combining weird science, cute visuals, sweet wit, and a strong environmental message.

(Little Senses)</h2><p><b>Patience, understanding, and a soothing exercise saves the beach day when excitement turns to sensory overload.</b><br><br>Going to the beach is exciting. But it can also be busy. And <i>loud.</i> Sand can feel hot or itchy or sticky...and it gets <i>everywhere!</i> In <i>This Beach Is Loud!</i>, a sensitive boy gets overwhelmed by all the sights, sounds, and sensations at the beach. Luckily, this kiddo's dad has a trick up his sleeve to help his son face these unexpected obstacles.<br><br>Combining accessible storytelling and playful design, <i>This Beach Is Loud! </i>gently offers practical advice for coping with new experiences to sensitive children on and off the autism spectrum.</p><p>Samantha Cotterill is an illustrator and textile designer. She works and resides with her family in Upstate New York.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;In this much-needed new series, author/illustrator Cotterill shows the excitement and challenges of going to the beach for the first time. Wearing his snorkel mask, a young boy is packed and ready for a day at the shore with his father. At the beach they seek a spot to set up their day camp. On their way, the itchiness of the sand and the surrounding noises becomes overwhelming for the young boy, but soon, after being able to soothe himself with a couple of techniques, he is able to play. Many children will be able to identify with the stresses of a new experience, and Cotterill, on the spectrum herself, has deliberately left this open-ended so any child with sensory processing disorder (SPD) and/or autism can identify with the experiences represented in the book. Ink, charcoal, and block print offer composition and texture capturing the beauty of the day. Overlapping text helps distill the feeling of certain senses being overwhelmed. Throughout the book, she subtly shows tools the family uses to prep for new experiences and for when things become overstimulating, paving the way for dialogic reading and conversations for readers whether they're neurodiverse or neurotypical.

Of the nearly thirty plays he wrote during his career, eleven are extant. Amongst the most famous of these is &#x201c;Lysistrata,&#x201d; a comedy which focuses on the women of Greece whose husbands have left for the Peloponnesian War. The women do not care about the conflict as much as they care about missing their husbands. Its titular character, Lysistrata, insists that men rarely listen to women&#x2019;s reasoning and exclude their opinions on matters of state. In retaliation she convinces the women of Greece to organize a strike, refusing to have sex with their husbands until both sides agree to cease fighting. The irony of this is that the men become more upset with their wives than they do with their enemies of war. Notable for its positive portrayal of women&#x2019;s rationality in a male-dominated society, &#x201c;Lysistrata&#x201d; stands as one the most popular and frequently performed plays from classical antiquity. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and is translated and annotated by the Athenian Society.</p><p></p><h2>Flight of the Phoenix (Nathanial Fludd, Beastologist) (Nathaniel Fludd, Beastologist, 1)</h2><p>Nathaniel Fludd&#x2019;s life has taken a turn for the worst.

Believed by the early Christians to have been the work of the Hermas referred to by the Apostle Paul in his letter to the Romans, this book was regarded as inspired Scripture by many and even included in several of the early canons. At the very least, the historical and universal acclaim of this work by those who were still burning with the recent fire of Pentecost demands a serious consideration of the message it gives to us; a message that, after nearly two thousand years, still exhales the prophetic fragrance of the ancient, apostolic faith. This version has been updated into modern language for a new generation to rediscover this captivating work of the early Church.</p><p></p><h2>We Are All Made of Molecules</h2><p><i>&nbsp;*"</i>This savvy, insightful take on the modern family makes for nearly nonstop laughs."<i>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews,</i>&nbsp;Starred<br><br>Stewart, 13: Socially clueless genius. <br>Ashley, 14: Popular with everyone but her teachers<br>&nbsp;<br>Ashley's and Stewart's&nbsp;worlds collide when Stewart and his dad move in with Ashley and her mom. <i>The Brady Bunch</i> it isn't.

Nielsen went on to pen sixteen episodes of the hit TV show. Since then, Nielsen has written for many Canadian TV series. <br><br>Nielsen&#x2019;s first two young adult novels, <i>Word Nerd </i>and <i>Dear George Clooney: Please Marry My Mom, </i>won critical acclaim and multiple young readers&#x2019; choice awards. <i>The Reluctant Journal of Henry K. Larsen </i>won the prestigious Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Award and the Canadian Library Association&#x2019;s Children&#x2019;s Book of the Year. She lives in Vancouver with her family and two extremely destructive cats.Gr 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;Thirteen-year-old Stewart and 14-year-old Ashley could not be more different. Stewart is a quirky, gifted intellectual who is coping with the loss of his mother, while Ashley is a popular fashionista still reeling from her parents' divorce&#x2014;brought about by her father's announcement that he is gay. When a serious relationship develops between Stewart's father and Ashley's mother, the two teens find themselves living under the same roof. By turns humorous and heartbreaking, the story is told in alternating chapters narrated by both protagonists. In comparison to Stewart, Ashley is somewhat underdeveloped, but the contrast between the two characters makes for a compelling read, particularly as they begin to challenge and influence each other. Their overlapping journeys will leave readers with much to think about, as Nielsen unflinchingly tackles issues such as bullying, bigotry, and tolerance; the true nature of friendship; and what it means to be a family. The book will appeal to fans of R.J. Palacio's Wonder (Random, 2012) and Jo Knowles's See You at Harry's(Candlewick, 2012).

Through careful use of historical documentation and clear identification of supposition from fact, the listener is given a balanced look at the first interaction of English settlers and Native Americans. Melissa Hughes reads the story with a tone of authority and compassion for all of the characters. She enlivens Pocahontas, a girl curious about these strangers who have come to her land.

His flying record of over 2,500 combat missions remains unmatched by any pilot since.Until his death in 1982 Hans Rudel remained a loyal supporter of Adolf Hitler, and National Socialism.

This is the definitive guide to how cold reading is used in the psychic industry. It systematically describes a wide range of techniques that enable those who give readings to make seemingly accurate statements to a complete stranger. These statements can refer to past, current or future events or to the client&#39;s personality, feelings and potential.This is primarily a descriptive book, not an instructional one.

For over 12 years Joel Martin documented evidence of Anderson's powers&#x2014;the ability to reach 'the other side'&#x2014;and repeatedly astonished believers and skeptics. This is the book of those universal visions, the inspiring messages of hope, truth, and peace, and a glimpse into eternity to answers to the unfathomable questions about life and death.</p><p>Put together by a radio-show personality who worked closely with medium George Anderson, <i>We Don't Die</i> is well documented, well written, and seems veracious. It is one of the most convincing accounts of communication with the deceased. A gentle religious man, Anderson was almost committed to a state mental hospital at age 16 because of his "visions," but by his 20s, he was helping spirits communicate with friends and relatives still residing on this plane of existence. Approximately 15 percent of the time he's <i>not</i> correct, and this is attributed to mix-ups in human communication or ignorance on the part of the questioner. The information that living folks pass between each other is often relayed or perceived inaccurately, so it seems logical that some perceptive error would occur in communications from the incarnate--particularly since a lot of these are conveyed through images, symbols, and tactile impressions. Anderson's conversations make for an engrossing read not to be missed. <i>--P.

As human beings, we continually tell ourselves stories -- of success or failure; of power or victimhood; stories that endure for an hour, or a day, or an entire lifetime. We have stories about our work, our families and relationships, our health; about what we want and what we're capable of achieving. Yet, while our stories profoundly affect how others see us and we see ourselves, too few of us even recognize that we're telling stories, or what they are, or that we can change them -- and, in turn, transform our very destinies. <br> <br> Telling ourselves stories provides structure and direction as we navigate life's challenges and opportunities, and helps us interpret our goals and skills. Stories make sense of chaos; they organize our many divergent experiences into a coherent thread; they shape our entire reality. And far too many of our stories, says Loehr, are dysfunctional, in need of serious editing. First, he asks you to answer the question, "In which areas of my life is it clear that I cannot achieve my goals with the story I've got?" He then shows you how to create new, reality-based stories that inspire you to action, and take you where you want to go both in your work and personal life. <br> <br> For decades, at the Human Performance Institute, Loehr has been examining the power of story to increase engagement and productivity, and Fortune 500 companies have paid millions to send employees to his program, in which he applies the principles and methods that he now offers in this book. Global business leaders, world-class athletes, military special forces, and thousands of individuals from every walk of life have sought out and benefited from his life-altering insight and expertise. <br> <br> Our capacity to tell stories is one of our profoundest gifts. Loehr's approach to creating deeply engaging stories will give you the tools to wield the power of storytelling and forever change your business and personal life.</p><p>Jim Loehr is chairman, CEO, and co-founder of the Human Performance Institute, a training company that has successfully utilized energy management technology to improve the productivity and engagement levels of elite performers from the world of business, sport, medicine, and law enforcement for over 30 years.

But if you're at all like the people I see in our workshops, then I'm afraid you understand the phrase all too well.</p><p>How did it come to this?</p><p>What am I doing?</p><p>Where am I going?</p><p>What do I want?</p><p>Is my life working on any meaningful level? Why doesn't it work better?</p><p>Am I right now dying, slowly, for something I'm not willing to die for?</p><p>WHY AM I WORKING SO HARD, MOVING SO FAST, FEELING SO LOUSY?</p><p>One man I heard about was quite literally going through slow death. A senior executive at a big firm, he was home the last few weeks of his life, in the final stage of cancer, in and out of lucidity, medicated so heavily that his tongue loosened and he regularly spewed his unfiltered, apparently truest thoughts. He cursed at his wife as never before, using vile, demeaning language -- all while she was caring for him day and night, knowing these were his last days on earth, the final days of their long marriage. He did the same to his kids when they visited, making an already difficult situation for them nearly intolerable, and certainly bringing them nothing remotely like peaceful closure. Mostly, though, the man's most shocking, blistering commentary was reserved, in absentia, for his boss: vicious, intermittently coherent paroxysms of resentment and contempt for the president of his firm who, it was painfully obvious now, the dying executive blamed for most of the anger, frustration, and general rottenness he'd felt the past two decades.</p><p>Slow death. It comes in different forms. Two years ago a heart surgeon came to our institute. The first morning he had his blood work done and took a turn in the BodPod (a chamber inside which one's lean body mass can be measured with exceptional accuracy, through the displacement of air rather than water). His results were borderline alarming -- extremely elevated levels of cholesterol, glucose, blood lipids, triglycerides, C-reactive protein. He was given a copy of the results.</p><p>When his turn came to discuss the meaning of the numbers and how to approach them, the surgeon said, "I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"You know what these numbers mean," said Raquel Malo, our director of nutrition and executive training.</p><p>"Of course I do," he snapped. "I'm a doctor!"</p><p>"What if I was your patient and I got these numbers?"</p><p>"I'd be all over you."</p><p>"Yet you're telling me -- "</p><p>"I said I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"But -- "</p><p>"Change the subject or I'm on the next plane home," he said. "Don't bring it up again while I'm here."</p><p>Two days later the doctor left, having done nothing to address his perilous health, or even to acknowledge there was anything to address. He returned to his thriving medical practice, where he would continue to caution patients to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. (Of all the demographics we see, health care providers as a group hover near the bottom in fitness and physical well-being.)</p><p>Slow death: what a harsh phrase. Is that really what's happening to all those people, the ones who start out contented by what is good and pure in life -- a simple cup of coffee, a few seemingly reasonable life goals (a nice salary, say, and one's own home) -- and who, once they've achieved those goals, can't even be satisfied because they've already moved on to life's next-sized latte (six-figure salary, second home, three cars), only to move on to something double-extra grande when that's achieved, a continual supersizing that guarantees one can't ever be fulfilled?</p><p>Okay. Not everyone I see or hear about is dying slowly. But to judge from the responses we get, workshop after workshop, year after year -- and each year it gets worse -- whatever it is they're doing sure doesn't sound fun. It doesn't even sound like getting by. I read the frustration and disappointment in their self-evaluations and hear it in their own voices, if and when they're comfortable enough to read aloud from their current dysfunctional story, the autobiographical narrative they attempt to write the first day at HPI, but usually don't finish until the night before our last day together.</p><p>"Life is hard and getting harder," read one senior VP, with a very big house, a very big salary, and dozens of direct reports. "My current life story is stagnant...On a scale of 1 [worst] to 5 [best], I'd give my health and family each a 2...My biggest feeling about myself is complete disappointment...I have virtually no energy...I'm completely addicted to cell phones and PDAs."</p><p>"The tone of my story is cynical, sarcastic, and ironic," read a forty-three-year-old woman who runs a successful telecom business in the Southwest. "I'm driven to achieve solely for the purpose of being able to point to the accomplishment, and the recognition I receive...I need a more positive view of my future...I do NOT embrace the idea that the story I tell about what happens is more important than what actually happens...My current life story is sad and depressing...My health is a 2, work a 3, happiness and friendship each a 2..."</p><p>"I'm deeply disappointed in myself and always extremely self-critical," wrote a managing director in a financial services firm. "My happiness is a 1; I'm as unhappy as can be. I'm getting divorced after thirty-three years of marriage...My greatest weakness is that I don't trust anyone anymore. The dominant theme in my life is distrust."</p><p>I hardly think it's overstating to call these tragic stories.</p><p>As the workshop progresses and people's defenses start to melt away, we hear more and more of these stories. By almost any reasonable standard, these stories exemplify failure; in many cases, disaster. There is no joy to be found in them, and even precious little forward movement. In every workshop, nearly everyone has a dysfunctional story that is not working in at least one important part of his or her life: stories about how they do not interact often or well with their families; about how unfulfilling the other significant relationships in their lives are; about how -- despite all that extracurricular failure -- they're not even performing particularly well at work (!), or, if they are, about how little pleasure they gain from it; about how they don't feel very good physically and their energy is depleted.</p><p>On top of all that (isn't that enough?), they feel guilty about their predicaments. They know, on some almost buried level, that their life is in crisis and that the crisis will not simply go away. Their company is not going to make it go away. The government is not going to make it go away. God is not going to make it go away.</p><p>And so they wake up one morning to the realization that the bad story they for so long only feared has become finally their life, their story. Not that this development is their fault. No. Nor is there a heck of a lot to be done about it.</p><p>It's a competitive, cutthroat world out there.</p><p>God knows, I want to change but I simply can't. I'll get eaten up and beaten by someone who's willing to sacrifice everything.</p><p>The world moves faster today than it did a generation ago.</p><p>Hey, at least I see my family some weekends. At least we've got a roof over our heads. At least I exercise twice a week.</p><p>What am I supposed to do -- quit my job?</p><p>These are the facts of my life. There's nothing I can do about them.</p><p>My life is a known quantity, so why mess with it even if it's killing me?</p><p>Let me repeat that one:...even if it's killing me.</p><p>As corporate consultant Annette Simmons says in her book, <i>The Story Factor</i>, "People don't need new facts -- they need a new story."</p><p>Recently I conducted a seminar with thirty-two engineers from a profitable company who'd been sent to us not of their own desire -- if it was up to them, it soon enough became obvious, they'd have preferred to undergo a colonoscopy and root canal simultaneously -- but because the head of their division, a recent and enthusiastic attendee of the program, felt it would be useful for them and thus for the company. I could tell that the brainpower in the room, judged on sheer intellectual payload, was staggering. Each engineer had a position of considerable authority, each had several direct reports, each was veteran enough at the company to feel part of the fabric that made it what it was. Early in the session, I asked what might be done to improve their situations at work. Not a single hand went up. When I asked what they thought about their latest job evaluations, the few who spoke expressed the same general idea: They were doing about as well as they expected; there wasn't much that would make things worse or better. It was what it was.</p><p>Over the next half hour, though, I was able to start eliciting some details. Many of them said they couldn't pay much attention to their health because, well, there was obviously no time to exercise before or after work, and to exercise in the middle of the afternoon would feel, as one said, "almost like you're irresponsible."</p><p>"Is there an actual rule against it?" I asked.</p><p>"It's unwritten," he said. "Everyone can feel it."</p><p>So there it was. The corporate culture was at fault. Nothing to be done about it. It was what it was.</p><p>I asked for a new show of hands: How many did get regular exercise? Four engineers out of thirty-two responded.</p><p>"They're single," said one of the others. Everyone laughed.</p><p>"Really?" I said. I turned to the Exercising Four. "How many of you have spouses and children?"</p><p>Three of the four raised their hands.</p><p>"You're married with kids, yet you work out," I said to them. "How is this possible?" I asked the three if they thought that the time they spent exercising was jeopardizing their careers, in the long term, or making it more difficult to get work done, in the short.</p><p>No, said each. "It makes me more productive," said one.</p><p>I then asked the whole group of thirty-two how many had dinner with their family at least three nights a week. Only five did...and -- what do we have here? -- three of the five were the Exercisers Married with Children.</p><p>Some people just figure it out. Why them and not others?</p></p><h2>My Dad Loves Me, My Dad Has a Disease: A Child&#39;s View: Living with Addiction</h2><p><p>Children who grow up in addicted families usually learn at a very young age that it is not safe for them to openly talk about their family experiences.

In these volumes, we find Ripley ensconced on a French estate with a wealthy wife, a world-class art collection, and a past to hide. In <em>Ripley Under Ground</em> (1970), an art forgery goes awry and Ripley is threatened with exposure; in <em>The Boy Who Followed Ripley</em> (1980), Highsmith explores Ripley's bizarrely paternal relationship with a troubled young runaway, whose abduction draws them into Berlin's seamy underworld; and in <em>Ripley Under Water</em> (1991), Ripley is confronted by a snooping American couple obsessed with the disappearance of an art collector who visited Ripley years before. More than any other American literary character, Ripley provides "a lens to peer into the sinister machinations of human behavior" (John Freeman, <em>Pittsburgh Gazette</em>).</p><p>In this harrowing illumination of the psychotic mind, the enviable Tom Ripley has a lovely house in the French countryside, a beautiful and very rich wife, and an art collection worthy of a connoisseur. But such a gracious life has not come easily. One inopportune inquiry, one inconvenient friend, and Ripley&#39;s world will come tumbling down--unless he takes decisive steps. In a mesmerizing novel that coolly subverts all traditional notions of literary justice, Ripley enthralls us even as we watch him perform acts of pure and unspeakable evil.Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.</p><h2>The Baptist Deacon: From a Pastor with a Special Heart for Deacons</h2><p>This book comes straight from the heart of a pastor who has had deacons for breakfast, dinner, and supper for as long as he can remember.

But those who have been through this experience--whose sons have married and turned against them as if they were dirt after all the years of love and care the parents gave them-will rejoice at finding this book and knowing they aren&#39;t alone. Actually, the desertion of parents by married sons is not uncommon. Would that it were! Almost every psychologist or counselor with whom I have talked knows of several instances in which it has happened. They speak of the great sorrow and agitation of the parents, mother and father alike, who can&#39;t understand why a child has turned against them.
